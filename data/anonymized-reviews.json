I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry.",

IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals. ",

            "text": "The lectures were thought by Dr. Goel, but the primary instructor was David Joyner. These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought. ",

            "text": "This was my first class in the OMSCS program and by far this was the best class I have taken during my formal CS education. I did get an A in the course for some perspective. The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)!",

Preparing for midterm now, which coveres 10 chapters. \nThe second project was a bit annoying to get the VM set up. I was sure I ran the malware analysis correctly, but don't think the results were coming out correctly. I got a new laptop after this project to ensure that I would not have any technical issues for the remainder of my OMSCS life. Project 4 and optional project 4. 5 were easy because I am familiar with JS and SQL. Project 3 was buggy, and the instructor recognized that stating that he will address that in future courses. \nI missed a bunch of quizzes because of poor time management, but still ended up with an A in the course. Overall the class touches upon many interesting topics and is a good second course to take with something more intense, such as ML. ",

            "text": "This class tests your ability to work with libraries and hunt down data & process. It is very poor at teaching you Machine Learning efficiently compared to the numerous other offerings on Coursera. \n\nDon't expect to understand the material presented. That apparently isn't the goal of the course because the instructors spend their time hand-waving and the assignments have you spend time debugging against shoddy tools. You won't learn to troubleshoot the thought process or algorithms, just to fiddle at the margins with the tools provided. The people who give this course favorable reviews are very strong coders but very weak on theory and math; they pull through because they can plug & chug the coding assignments and use the crappy tools. Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments. Basically if you're modestly good at Java (or expertly good with Python and R ML libraries) and have a lot of time to learn to use APIs for existing ML tools, then you're fine. Perhaps that's what all CS courses are like?",

I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so. \n Throughout the lectures and the problem sets, it feels like you are being assisted like a 5 year-old: everything is well explained, you wouldn't notice much if you do not have a good grip. The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem. Most of my classmates talk about using an algorithm not even discussed in the lectures for solving the Final Project. \n\n The TAs are very helpful. They do their best to up the participation, even create interesting videos every week. When somebody asks questions, they are quick to dive in. And when they do, they do not just answer: they give expounded explanations like how things might be different for other cases.

When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.

Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback. All these result in a lot of noise on Piazza, you have to go through 10K+ posts on piazza during the semester if you want to keep up. \n\nThey dropped MATLAB Fall2015, from now on you can only do your homework in Python. And unless you are good at Python (including advanced things like optimization and parallelization in NumPy), you'll spend a few nights debugging for sneaky bugs or screaming over algorithms that run for 40 minutes. \n\nAll in all: it is a good class but there is a room for some improvement.

He more or less establishes a standard (most consider it on the overzealous side of the spectrum) and grades accordingly. It is rather appalling to take a course where the instructor doesn't instruct, the lectures are given by a previous instructor and TA, but they aren't always on target with the course requirements and the level of rigor that is required, the instructors are somewhat responsive on the forum (the only clsas contact is via Piazza), office hours are explicitly NOT conducted, and NO outside resources or collaboration are allowed on homework! Basically, self-teach, but you're not even allowed differing perspectives to help really solidify what the student is supposed to learn. Sure, there are problem sets that are circulated that students are allowed to collaborate on and use outside resources for, but there really isn't much time to do those if focusing on the required homeworks first. Also, it's more miss than hit that the instructor will provide solutions to the practice problems to know if you're getting it or not. If you're up for a quite hefty challenge that definitely is a psychological one as well, go for it, but know it will be rough. It's fairly demoralizing, and I've taken undergrad algorithms, theory, discrete math and proofs within the past 7 years! There were some changes between this past fall and the present semester, but unless they make MAJOR changes to where this course is actually taught and supported, I'd recommend going with the II specialization unless you're determined to struggle for the specialization you really want. I understand it's a tough subject and students should expect a challenge, especially from an institution like GA Tech, but the department really should evaluate their strategy for this one. Also, check the instructor's reviews prior to the program... not very positive previously w/ other subjects!",

Weeks when I was working on the project, more like 20-25 was required. \n\nThis was a really interesting course. I would rate the lectures and papers A+, moderately challenging while extremely interesting and informative, ie. the perfect class in my opinion. \n\nThe only thing I didn't love about the class is the project. You're given a single challenge and then three attempts to build an AI agent that can handle it. It's the same problem (taking a visual IQ test) each time, but the difficulty is increased as time goes on. \n\nThe first version of the project was interesting and pretty fun. But by the second time I was getting a little tired of it, and now I'm working on v3 and I'm not so excited about it. \n\nThe reason is, I feel the project has devolved into a test of my image processing skills rather than an test of knowledge-based AI programming. I didn't mind that on a single project, but I wish we'd gotten to try something different for p2 and p3 instead of the same thing just harder. \n\nHowever, in the scheme of things, the project isn't too bad and the class remains really fun. The Piazza forum is extremely active, and Dr. Goel is highly responsive and engaging with the students. \n\nThis was my first class in OMSCS and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first few weeks confirmed all my excitement for this program. I'd highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in the subject, and also for first-semester students (but take it by itself!).",

This is probably one of the best classes I've ever taken in my life. \n\nThis class is hard. If you are not a competent c programmer with an understanding of basic algorithms you will probably not make it through this class. However, this class is also completely awesome. The lectures are incredibly well done and are interspersed with actual good humor by Prof. Vudoc. The projects are all very interesting. There are 5 of them and I've spent about 20 hours on each. I could have spent double that time optimizing them, but my efforts were good enough to get close to 95% on most. \n\nThe midterm was brutally hard. I have not taken the final yet but expect it will be the same. However, the grading structure is such that you can get a 50% on the midterm and final, yet still get an A or B in the class if you do excellent on the programming projects.",

One of my favourite classes ever, you will be exposed to roughly a dozen machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe first half of the class is the most difficult. Understanding the math, ideas, requirements for papers and midterm can be a little discouraging. The second half proved to be much easier and even more interesting. I was ready to drop the class at the midpoint but ended up finishing with a top mark. \n\nAt the start of the course you have choose 2 datasets which is the basis of all your work and papers. The problem is that course does not explain what qualifies as a good dataset to study. Its a tradeoff between the training time, sample size and the number of dimensions. To little data and there is no difference between the various algorithms. Too much data and it will take a long time to run your programs. My first dataset was too simple and the second didn't have enough data to train - given the number of inputs (dimensions). I would seek clarification before finalizing the dataset choice as the idea is to compare all the algorithms on the same dataset. \n\nThe instructors are highly entertaining and seasoned experts in their field.",

Do not have high expectation coming in to the class, there is no spoon feeding. You are pretty much on your own with your fellow classmates and you should form offline/online study groups asap. Try to proactively organize discussion on piazza about the problem set and collaborate with your classmate and attack them as soon as possible. You might (policy can change) see those questions reappearing in the exams. \n\nA tip about getting most out of your study group, be very WELL prepared. Do not expect to discuss and learn on the fly, you'll fall behind and/or not understanding what is being discussed. Read all the material and understand the question in advance. \n\nPart 1 is the warmup of the course, if you're rusty with writing proof, here's your chance to practice, this is the least difficult part of the course, which will still kick your butt. \n\nLanguages & Countability\nTuring Machines\nChurch-Turing Thesis\nUniversality\nUndecidability\n\nPart 2 of the course starts with P and NP and ends with Approximation & Randomized Algorithms (they are harder to prove). \n\nP and NP\nNP - Completeness\nNPC Problems\nApproximation Algorithms\nRandomized Algorithms\n\nPart 3 of the course will kick your butt.

I have only a sliver of a Java background, and this was enough to get through the paper just fine. \n* This course covers things like using an IDE and git. If you're a working programmer like myself, you will probably already know this. \n* The grading on the group assignments is focused on the paperwork you produce, not the code. We turned in an assignment that failed half the instructor tests and still got an 80 or 85. \n* There is a significant amount of group work in this paper. I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material. The course is about the software development process, not coding, and it covers a lot of tools that aren't relevant to me as a working programmer, e. g. UML, Rational Unified Process, e. t. c. However this is the point of the course so I shouldn't be too surprised :)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper to take if you're new to OMSCS and want an easier paper to start with, to learn the ropes of taking papers. If you've already met your foundational requirement, and aren't interested in more enterprisey processes, and are looking for challenging papers, then I wouldn't recommend this one.

In spite of the experience, I learned loads from this class - especially on the L3 side. The projects are fun, and shouldn't be a problem if you know Python (an absolute must for this class). The TAs and Prof. are super active in Piazza and Office Hours are also conducted twice in a week. \n\nThis course requires reading of published papers apart from video lectures (which I found not rich in details - might be a problem for students not exposed to networking concepts earlier from school / work). There are 2 closed-book proctored tests involving a plethora of multiple choice, descriptive-types, and problem-types questions. It is important to internalize the concepts mentioned in the papers and video lectures if you want to do well in the tests. ",

A great difference from ML is that ML focuses more on bench-marking/ comparing different algorithms, but AI is the opposite, asks you to create algorithm from scratch. A lot of mysteries in ML for me are answered in this class. I tend to disagree with other people about the assignments though... I don't think they are that difficult if you some background in statistics, I finished many of the assignments in 2~3 days, I wouldn't say that's ideal though. \n\nOverall a really great course to survey many of the AI topics, sometimes it felt to me they are rushing through the topics. I do wish them to separate these into two-semester long course so we could go deeper in some of the topics or maybe open a follow-up advanced level course though. \n\nThe piazza is really active, almost too active that I could barely follow, but I guess that's always good.

He and the TAs are insanely responsive and always have a nice mix of hints & wit in their replies. \n\nThe assignments start off pretty simple and ramp up near the end. The third section can be challenging but very satisfying to see things working. The lectures are really wonderful, and the textbooks are also fantastic, which is something I rarely say. \n\nMy sole complaint is a big one: the mid-term. Essentially the class compiles a list of questions for the mid-term, which culminates into a 700-question bucket. Those who did well largely memorized as much of this as possible. It seemed like a large amount of busy work and taking exams based on memorization is a pretty crummy way to spend a Sunday. \n\nSo prepare for a really great, fun course with one bummer in the middle.

There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution.

I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit.

The lectures cover an extremely wide range of topics, while there is sometimes more of an emphasis on the math than the intuition, you come away with a lot. \n\nThe projects you work on in this course are some of the coolest things I've ever worked on. If they offered another CV course with more projects like this, I would take it in a heartbeat. Seeing the output of an algorithm that you implemented to track a hand in a video for example, that's just awesome. \n\nThe time requirement is very real. The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it. I would HIGHLY recommend learning numpy and at least brushing up on opencv basics before taking this course. I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course. Also, I did not do this, but I wish I had taken Computational Photography first. There were a few posts on Piazza about how much that helped. ",

He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS).

You can easily find youself wasting all your project time on trying to make these decisions. One important note is that the curve is very kind. Fight the urge to drop the class because of results and difficulty; it is worthwhile to stick with it. They seem to enjoy making everyone think they are failing and then curving to mostly A's and B's. Hopefully you will have some benevolent genius classmates that are active on piazza as well - I know I could not have done it without them. ",

As a computer scientist you can expect pretty much every job interview to include algorithmic questions. This class will not prepare you at all for it. You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught. When half the class drops by the withdrawal date and the remaining half gets a C or lower, you're really not teaching anything and you actually didn't do your job as an instructor, in my opinion. ",

            "text": "Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well. ",

I felt that the two person teaching format worked really well for the course, to the point where I started to question why all courses didn't do this. It sort of reminded me of the back and forth in a RadioLab podcast. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and even though I have some background in Machine Learning, I felt I took away a lot of new insights from this course. \n\nIs it hard? I guess. I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course. ",

I personally did not have much big data experience but by the time I completed the homework assignments I was ready to design and implement a large scale experiment on Hadoop for my project without major issues. \n\nOn the negative side, the lectures and other course content are pretty thin. There was a fairly large gap between content the course provides and what was needed to actually complete the assignments, so most of what I learned in the course was through looking up tutorials and other course materials on the Internet. By far the biggest negative was the workload required for the first three homework assignments, I spent at least 40+ hours per week on the assignments over the six weeks that were given to complete them. The assignments themselves were not necessarily difficult to complete (although one assignment required deriving an equation used throughout the rest of the assignment which the course itself in no way prepares you for), but it's very much as if an entire semester's worth of assignments are crammed into that first part of the course. There were some other minor negatives to the course, mostly in the form of the course being disorganized and instructions being vague or conflicting. \n\nOverall I would say this could be a great course and I personally learned a lot from it, but I can't recommend it in its current form.

As a qualification, I am of the student build that didn't come with a complete CS background, instead having a degree in IT with an emphasis in programming. However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps. I expect that the course will get better with time. ",

I'm not sure if the tools you learn in the assignments will be used in your future career, but they do serve the purpose of helping you learn. You'll need some knowledge about Java and at least be able to debug pointer related errors. The exams are difficult but open notes.

Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to \"study\" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse.

This course is very helpful in many ways, one of which is that the concepts covered here are used in pretty much every other course (and I've taken 2 others so far). At the end of the day, computer science is a lot about math - not just programming, and understanding the principles behind the programs we write is just as important. I was just as frustrated when taking the course - the countless times I've complained, the near nervous breakdowns and the constant frustration of not being able to solve the assignment problems on my own. However, it's been over a year since I took this course and I am still enjoying the fruits of it. Also, it doesn't matter if you get an A or a B on this course - what matters is how much you learn. To be honest grades don't really dictate success in life anyways. A few things to succeed in this course\n\n1. Be prepared - take some preparatory courses if this is the first time you are taking such a course. There are plenty on Coursera on Design of Algorithms. \n2. Set aside at-least 30 hours a week. If you are working and have a family, ensure that this is the only course you take that term. \n3. Struggle on the assignments - try as hard as you can on each of the problems. But don't be afraid to ask the TAs for hints and to Google for help (don't cheat, but ask for help and cite your references). \n4. The video lectures are not sufficient. Read the textbooks - especially ones recommended for each section. \n5. Solve as many problems as you can - Google for exam papers from other colleges. ",

Switching from Java to Python and back\n\nI'd recommend sticking with the following libraries/packages for the various assignments \n1. Weka for Assignment 1 (many also used Python and R)\n2.

The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved. ",

The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly.

            "text": "This class is not like any other class in the program (as of today). Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it. ",

I didn't know what I was getting into until the classes started, but quickly I realized this was going to be tough. \n\nThere's more material in this course that what you can cover without going nuts. The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to. \n\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up. \n\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade.",

            "text": "Content - The Udacity videos did a good job of presenting the course information. They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\". \n\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it's also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\n\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I've heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That's unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material. \n\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average. \n\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you'll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard. You'll get exposed to a lot of interesting ideas and use a variety of tools to explore those ideas, which hopefully encourage you to learn more in the future. I highly recommend this course. ",

A lot of the material has really stuck and I have been able to apply these principles to subsequent classes. \n\nI felt this class was more time consuming than hard. It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light. But at the same time, this is a survey course that aims to cover a lot of topics, so perhaps it is not realistic to increase the depth too much without sacrificing breadth. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course!",

            "text": "This course is very hands-on and you'll get very awarding learning experience, but it's best to take it with another easy course or on its own. \n\nThe difficulty highly depends on how much time you can allocate. Nothing is impossible but every single part of every assignment is time consuming. There are 4 homework assignments due every 2 weeks for the first part of the course and a project for the second half. Every assignment involves serious effort. Expect to spend several full days on each. This course covers several big data tools, but it's not a programming course. So you need to learn on your own well enough to finish the assignments. Make sure you start early. Assignments are assessed by autograding using different data sets than the ones you have, so I kind of miss the Udacity autograder that I used to hate, since at least you know you get it when you get it. The project focuses more on your ability to interpret data and understand the topic you choose. Your report/paper will be graded for the project, not your code. \n\nThe instructors and TAs are very active on piazza and helpful. It's a new course so there are some problems every once a while, so make sure you keep an eye on the announcement and pinned messages, in case there's any code or instruction update. The teaching staff are aware of the problems and are trying their best not to make things confusing. It's not perfect but they listen to suggestions and will likely make this course more organized.

            "text": "I continued breaking my rule of avoiding courses on their first run once again, when I took CS 6400. \n\nHaving made it through the entire semester, I found this course to be very easy at the beginning. The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I'm surprised the instructors didn't put the kibosh on that. )\n\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn't quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new. Dr. Mark, while no longer actively researching, clearly is an expert in the topic and has great opinions. The lead TA did a commendable job keeping things organized. It was a good experience. ",

What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources. ",

The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs. \n\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early. \n\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there. \n\nOverall, it is a very good class.

Know you algorithmic analysis. I found that I had to brush up on a few areas of maths during the course which didn't help under the heavy workload. Knowing some linear algebra is also helpful as 2 large sections of the course work with matrices. The assignments are mostly done in C, so make sure you're well versed with that. The level of C needed is (imho) about the same as that for AOS or similar courses. \n\nThe class is hard because achieving high performance is a difficult problem. If you do this class, you'll discover that even something simple like sorting which you may have mastered from undergrad now becomes an order of magnitude more complex and if you don't do it right you may have severely degraded performance even though you have N times more computing power. \n\nI highly recommend this class. Even if you're not solving a problem across many compute nodes, performance will always be important and this class will give you the right tools to write high performance software. ",

I found the exams to be more difficult than the assignments personally, mostly due to the format. Sadly, I didn't do as well on them as I would have liked and feel I could have done better on them. My recommendation is to take detailed notes as you watch the lectures and read the papers. Especially take notes as you read the papers. Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you're watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you're having difficulty focusing on the lectures. \n\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit. \n\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you're going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\n- Learn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you'll need it (you probably don't)\n- Learn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you're not comfortable with the language's semantics you'll be overwhelmed on the first assignment. \n- Learn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there. \n\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn't adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent. Professor Ada and the TAs were super responsive. I don't recall ever having to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a response ever. I definitely recommend taking this course. ",

            "text": "Quote: this course is a survey of algorithmic hacks to NP-hard problems. In reality, it was interesting to learn about present-state AI research from prof. Starner and his work in Sign Language recognition, wearable computing, and Dolphin communication. This course was the initial offering of 6601 for the OMSCS program. The professor and the TAs input an enormous amount of effort to pull off this course - my thanks to them. As a note of context, this course was advertised to be offered in Spring '16 and then cancelled late Fall '15 and then surprisingly re-released at the 11th hour. \n\nAs the course advertises in its description, it is intended for those who have some background in AI or are ready to jump into the deep end (true statement) The description asks for 9 hrs per week and it should be modified to reflect the true effort required in this class. Most students, including myself, input 20+ hours per week to stay afloat. Most of the time you spend will be on solving an assignment and researching. It's very easy to forget that you have to watch the lectures as well! \n\nThe professor's assignment methodology was to introduce a concept through lecture, then complete some 'warm-up' problems in the beginning of each assignment to develop intuition. At the end of the warm-up, you solve more difficult problems by implementing solutions that had not been explicitly covered in class. This was certainly the most rewarding and difficult part of the class!\n\nThere were several first-time hiccups in assignments and exams, however the TAs and the professor had open ears and minds and ultimately made it right and I'm sure that the next offering of this course will be even better. \n\nI learned an incredible amount about the material even though I felt overwhelmed during the majority of the course. This is certainly an opportunity to become familiar with the AI field with an intensive, hands-on experience from which you will benefit greatly. ",

Just for example - a major project of the class (The \"FHIR Activity\") was supposed to be a programming project. It ended up being 10 question, open-book quiz on t-square (that we could take as many times as possible and receive the highest grade), that was worth 15% of our grades. I took it 4 times in about 30 minutes with the reading material in front of me and got a 100% on it. \n\nI don't think even one assignment avoided having its due date changed. The course stuff repeatedly promised assignment materials by a certain date, and then consistently released them a week+ later and then changed the due date to compensate (and consequently acted like they were doing everybody a favor). \n\nThe lecture material was somewhat interesting, but there was literally only several hours of lectures total. \n\nThis class was an easy A at least. Don't bother with it unless that's what you're looking for or if you already have a great project idea that you want to explore with a group. ",

I ended up with a C, and I think it was just due toward the end of the class where I couldn't focus on it so much because I was spending all my time with my other life sucker of a class. \n\nThe material in this course is dense, rigorous, but it did seem regularized. The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems. I really had a time crunch, but like I said, I unknowingly set myself up for it by taking the big data class. \n\nThere could be something fundamental I was not getting, but over all, even if I liked it to some extent, this isolation method didn't seem like the best way to learn. I get it, that a degree in any establishment is given better credit when the students are not spoon fed answers. Yet, I felt like I did not have the proper tools to achieve an A. It's frustrating for sure, I don't know if I should take another semester and switch specializations or just try it again. I am a bit discouraged after it all. I did try to understand the material as I have done with my other classes. \n\nYeah, don't take this with any other high demanding course. Please don't. ",

The homework is harder than the exams, but you have two weeks for each assignment and have the ability to submit revised answers based on the homework feedback, so don't let the homework take too much time away from working through problem sets as they will help sharpen your intuition. Get the CLRS book, it's not really optional. \n\nThe lectures videos aren't that good, the videos Chris made for select problem set solutions were great and helped a lot before the exam. \n\nOverall it's a good class. Would be better with better videos. You probably won't be able to apply anything here, but I do feel like it will sharpen your mind and improve your problem solving skills.

Trying to learn those skills while taking this course won't work at all. To be honest, the instructor clearly explains that, and gives a fair warning on the first week of class. Trying to do that would be like trying to learn Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the same time (as someone recently mentioned). \n\nThe instructor and TA seem very involved in improving the experience for all students. New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's. So that really makes a difference. \n\nIt was mentioned that there will be further enhancements to this course next term. Something else: do try to take advantage of every extra credit opportunity (if given). \n\nI definitely can say that I learned A LOT. There where weeks were I spent my weekdays after office 8pm-1am, and weekends all day long reading, working on homework, watching lectures from other universities.

However, there are things that should have been taken care of by a professor who has tough the subject before. To start with, we did not have a syllabus. The one provided by the teacher was a very high level organization of the course, which did not help much. We, students were the ones who put together a syllabus. The organization of the course was terrible as well. We had 4 exams. The first two covered easy material with plenty of time. The last two covered much more difficult material with less time to study it. Many questions on the open-book tests were written in a convoluted manner, so difficult to understand that even the professor gave the wrong answers to the TAs consistently in the first 3 tests for about 10% of the questions. \n\nEach exam had 25 questions worth 1 point each but, at the end, the exam grade was multiplied by 4. Many questions covered more than one knowledge item so if you missed one of the concepts you would still have the whole question wrong. \n\nYou need to start early studying for exams. Once the exam period starts (and I'm not talking about the actual exam), we were not allowed to ask any questions regarding the subjects covered on the test, which I thought was an unfortunate and ill-advised rule. \n\nThe TAs were very helpful and questions were answered right away. In addition, many of the students taking the class had advanced DB knowledge and were eager to help in Piazza. \n\nThe subject was very interesting and a must (the subject of DBs) for any student on this program.

This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric. ",

The software analysis tool used was the one developed by the professor and it had limited documentation and no practical value unless you are into system programming, IDE development, Compiler design etc. \n\nSoftware Test part of this course is good and has some practical use. Software Analysis is good to know and is explained well but not applicable to everyone. \n\nIf you are just looking to add one course to complete the course requirements, stay away from it. If you are not specializing in systems, stay away from it. ",

I personally do not care about the Relational Algebra or some other theoretical stuff, but I do care about practical skills that I can put into use in industry. \nI like the layout of this course given a hands-on project is included. The project mimics a real-world request from an IT company's imaginative client --- Students were required to form a group of 4 and the eventual goal is to design both a DB and a web interface ( something like a php UI) for a tool rental company's employees to look up/update the DB. Very interesting! \n\nNevertheless, I don't really agree with the course creator on the grading breakdown. The four exams accounted for too much of a percentage (15% each), while the final phase of the course project took us 20+hours per week but it accounted for merely 10%.

All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own). \n\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning. \nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading. \nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points. \n\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome! One or two of the TA's are also fairly engaged but the rest generally don't help out on Piazza. \n\nMake sure you watch the schedule carefully. Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced. However, messing up one assignment, especially from something silly like using a disallowed library or not making sure it works in the grading environment can cost you a lot, possibly even a letter grade for a big assignment. \n\nOne problem with the class when I took it was that the assignments were not finalized in advance, and sometimes not even until a couple days before the due date. Not only does this interfere with working ahead but having the requirements get changed after you already submitted is rather annoying. ",

The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each.

Office hours are also consistent. \n\nNumber of hours spent: I had to work during lunches (every day during weeks when projects were due or an exam was being held), and an hour or two after work if I'm not already wiped out. Also had to devote several hours on weekends for projects and studying for exams. \n\nOverall, a very solid and straightforward class. There aren't any tricks or gotchas in my opinion, and results will accurately reflect the amount of work you put in. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. ",

            "text": "This course is needlessly difficult in ways that impede learning outcomes. The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.

Professor and TA's were very responsive on the Piazza forms, though they were at time slow on returning assignment and project grades as well as updating mistakes in the grading. \n\nOverall the workload depended on the week. When there were no projects released or assignments due, I would typically spend only a few hours a week. When a project was due, I would spend closer to 20 hours a week. I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid. \n\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches. ",

There is a generous curve (80+ was an A in our class). \n\nThe programming projects are all in C, so if you are not familiar with C, it would be a good idea to take a refresher. If you are not a strong programmer, you will really struggle with the projects. I had very little C experience, but did my undergrad in CS and have been a software engineer for about 5 years and the first programming project probably took me about 50 hours to complete. ",

You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment. ",

But that’s more because I wanted to deliver a ‘nice looking UI’ with a close-to-non-existent Android expertise. \n\nThe contents are pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the ‘optional’ office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don’t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.

Some take an insane amount of time to complete, while others are very easy. The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones. This was very unprofessional and should have been handled discretely without obnoxiously threatening the entire class. \n\nAll in all. It was a solid class with a good amount of work.

            "text": "This was the first course I took as an OMS student and it was a great introductory course to get used to the framework of OMS (Piazza, Udacity, T-Square). \n\nThe assignments and project guidelines were fairly straightforward, though there was a pretty wide disparity in grading leniency among TAs. I'd expect rubrics in future iterations of this course. Best advice I can give would probably be to establish how and when your team will meet/communicate/collaborate for projects early on, and try to keep up with the Piazza threads. \n\nProf Orso had great lectures and was very consistent with office hours. I really enjoyed the Hangouts Live format of office hours. Overall, great introductory course for the program!",

I liked Thad's approach to designing assignment and exams, particularly the aspect that assignment start with topics covered in lectures but then gradually goes beyond so that you have to research more advanced topic.

So being a python programmer, I moved on to sk-learn, and mdp toolbox which also worked very well for the assignments and within couple of months after course I started using the algorithms at work. Piazza was very active and everyone was helpful. Only thing I didn't like was that mid-term exam was way too long, which I don't think really serves the purpose. ",

I front-loaded, but still was crippled by the math (lots of trig and rotational motion) for the RR( runaway robot). Groups formed off super early, and it's all cliques of people with too much brain power together to make it fair for grading according to their head-to-head rubric.

However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned. ",

Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue. ",

The learning curve is very strange, the 1st project(Runaway Robot) had some hard moments, but then final project really through me(and many others) for a loop.

I do think the ratings on this class at the time I took it are very deceiving. Perhaps others didn't need the time I took but the projects both required quite a bit of time. I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning. ",

The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.

This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 …. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment. ",

The exams are a midterm and final, and the final is not cumulative. \n\nThe projects: These took me from 6 to 12 hours each. The projects were:\n1. Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other. \n\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn. The class average for the first exam was an 80. I'm writing this before getting the results of the final exam. \n\nBonus project: the professors graciously allowed us a 10% extra credit project. Do it - it's fire insurance against a bad exam performance and can almost guarantee you the A. \n\nFinal verdict: this class was fun, and I learned a lot.

Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution. ",

Provides a decent overview of computer security concepts, but doesn't dive into most of them very deeply. \n\nLectures:\nSome of the lectures are quite long. Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I've had so far, but not terrible either. \n\nHomework:\nThere's a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it's best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit. \n\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade. \n\nTests\nTests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn't take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThe TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days. \n\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects. \n\nBook:\nThe textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst. You _might_ be able to get by without the textbook here, but it was extremely useful in studying for tests and quizzes. \n\nConclusion:\nWorth taking if you're looking for a summer class and don't have broad knowledge of information security concepts.

There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research. ",

The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions. All because of highly weighted exams that were regularly regraded because the answer keys were wrong or in some cases the questions didn't even have clear right answers at all. ",

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it. ",

In project work, visual approach is mandatory by the end and it involves mostly ad-hoc heuristics for RPM problems rather than any widely applicable AI algorithms. So you don't get hands on practice of learnt concepts. However, in textual approach I was able to implement some general technique based on learnt concepts, avoiding most hard coding or ad-hoc heuristics. \n3.

On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia. You may have a bad trip. \n\nThat said this class is not really the monster it is made out to be. Complaints about it being too mathy or taught by a math professor are misguided. It is very mathy and you should accept that for a theoretical computer science course. For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck. ",

Firstly while I ranked the class Easy because it is pretty easy to do the base requirements of the class, I actually spent the same number of hours per week on this course in the summer terms as I have spent per week on ML and CCA during the full terms. This is partly a factor of the reduced term period, but also because I also spent a lot of extra hours on Above & Beyond work for the homeworks just because I got obsessed and was having fun. If you restrain your enthusiasm then you will reduce your workload by a large amount. On the other hand I think putting in the extra time will help you get more out of it because the base parts of all the homework assignments are pretty easy and simple. \n\nWhile the material and base assignments were pretty simple, this summer the assignments were being reworked for autograding which meant they were not released in advance, so it made dealing with summer travel more difficult as we had about 2 assignments due each week for the first two months of the course. The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won't be a problem). \n\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material. However in the 6th and 7th lecture modules of the course they cover more specialized topics that were interesting and for the \"8th\" module we were given a collection of 6 academic papers to read. Reading those were my favorite section of the course and I highly recommend reading them early as they give some good ideas for final projects. Like the above & beyond work, you will get more from the class if you challenge yourself on the final project - that gives you a chance to go deep into an interesting area of your choice.

It's got nothing to do with embedded software/programming. \nClose to 1/3rd of the course is dedicated to ILP, VLIW etc which are more an computer architecture topic. CS6290 will provides a more solid foundation in this area (although not specific to VLIW based processors). \nThe next part deals with different aspects of compiler optimizations for VLIW based processors which was clearly more interesting. The lecture videos give a decent introduction to the topic & rest of the details had to be uncovered in the research papers on the topics. \nThe assignments were mostly appropriate to the topics covered in lectures. The TAs as well as Prof. were always active on piazza to that was helpful. They regularly had office hours so there was never a dull moment during the course. \nOverall I would recommend the course if you are interested in very low level working of embedded architectures & compiler optimization for embedded processors.

I took it over the summer and was disappointed that Dr. Isbell was not very interactive in the class... the TAs ran the show daily/weekly. They were extremely helpful and responsive (above average). As always, start everything early. There were two projects and a single (final) exam over the summer, but I understand the 'regular' semesters have had a 3rd project and an extra exam. New developments for the summer: The class was language agnostic and you didn't have to submit code... just auto-graded for the weekly assignments. No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule. I'd say it's a must-take if you're interested in RL. There's a ton of reading, though, and the lectures are fairly dense... not a class you can run the videos on 2x the first time through!",

I had prior backgrounds on some of the topics covered, and this class helped me to assemble the bits and pieces together. \n\nLectures: they cover really broad range of topics, from buffer overflow (low level application security) to web security. Each topic is not discussed in great details, but given that this course is an introductory course, this is quite expected. \n\nQuizzes: Most of the questions are taken straight from the book. If you watch the lectures and read the book, it is very easy to get 100% for the quizzes. \n\nProjects: The projects are fun, and help to understand and appreciate the topics better. Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security. The workload is quite reasonable, and definitely will be lighter on normal spring / fall semesters. ",

Ideally, this course would have resident Robotics experts, i. e. , people who do this for a living. \n\n2) It might be a good idea for the instructors to ensure that students are indeed learning different techniques (e. g. , SLAM). A midterm or final exam would be helpful. \n\n3) Encourage or even enforce the \"AI\" part in \"AI for Robotics\". Needless to say, providing help on these techniques (e. g. , the math for some filters) would be key. \n\nIn a summary, it's a good course to take (and to score a good grade in), especially if you are not in an \"auto-pilot\" mode. \n\nI come from a SE background, so I had some reservations taking a course that would require some math/physics.

The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge.

The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students. The confusion, stupid fast workload and angst all made what should have been an enjoyable survey course one of my least favorite in the program as far as organizational issues went.

They attempted to be fair for the most part and I appreciate their efforts. \n\nNow for the negatives. First problem, completely non-existent professor. He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed. There was some good material but it was mostly hidden away behind all the useless items I had to learn about.",

I would advise that there is a TON of \"ticky-tacky\" grading in certain assignments especially where instructions are incredibly vague or opaque. I struggled not because the material was difficult but because assignments were never entirely clear or the lectures didn't adequately prepare for assignments so you're left researching stack overflow and other places for hours. The projects depending on Android development was a blast! It was cool to see Orso start us off on a mobile project and then implement some of the SDP concepts on the project. Also, you're gonna need a good team for the project. By good I'm not talking about dev-savvy (though it helps). Good in this context means good communicators and overall team members. I had a fantastic team where we could depending on each other and split work appropriately. At the end of the day though, I have a tad bit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of a few assignments and some grading that I didn't agree with 100% (and I'm not the complaining type for this stuff). If Orso and his crew were to re-work some assignments this would be a 5/5 course for me. As it stands it's somewhere between a 3-4/5",

I'd say this is a good course to pair with another one, it has a medium load. Also I think this would be a very nice introduction to ML topics. Basic calculus/probability concepts are needed for the second part of the course. \n\nHomework and projects feature open ended questions, where you explain/justify your answers (report) and also provide the R code you wrote to justify your analysis (tables, plots, etc). It's also helpful if you already have experience writing \"vectorized code\" (like in Matlab, Python with Numpy/Pandas, etc). \n\nSyllabus:\n\n- R programming (most of the course will be in R)\n- data visualization\n- data processing\n- logistic regression\n- linear regression\n- high dimensions and regularization\n \nEach one of those \"chapters\" is covered in two weeks, so typically in that lapse of time you watch the lectures and work on the homework/project associated with that chapter. \n\nGrading: \nThe course features three assignments, an individual project (divided in a midterm project, and final project), and a final (open book, not multiple choice) exam with the grade distributed equally between these components (33% all hw, 33% project, 33% exam). \"",

In the end, I actually had a C but on the final I had answered a question correctly, but not the way he wanted me to and eventually he allowed that I had not only answered it correctly but has proved my answer and so he gave me full credit (I couldn't argue for partial credit) for the question and I got to a B. \n\nThe lectures need to be redone and I think they really need to think about how they have structured the course.",

As I write this review, we're only 10 weeks in the course. \n\nI have a BS in CS, and this makes me familiar with some topics in HCI, such as Usability. I'd say it is an intro to the broad field of HCI. There is no prerequisite for CS 6750, and you'll be perfectly fine with a different background. \n\nThe workload is very light at 15 h/w, more or less. There is one written assignment each week, which consists of four questions, and each should be answered with up to 300 words. Answering the questions requires watching weekly lectures, and reflecting on their objectives. These assignments are publicly available at: http://omscs6750. gatech. edu/fall-2016/full-course-calendar/\n\nCS6750 is very different from code-intensive courses that have coding assignment (e. g. CS 6300 SDP). In HCI, you will describe and analyze user interfaces. I think everyone that designs computerized products should take this course. It gives you a different perspective to look at your tasks, and the interface you use to achieve your goals. \n\nThe Video Lectures are not publicly available, but you can view the Scripts at: https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/0B1-VjNQe61hsYi1YanNYYzdkd3c\n\nIn addition to weekly assignments, there are two exams that should be taken via Proctortrack. These exams are open-note; which means you may watch the lectures as you answer the exams, or review your notes. \n\nFacts:\nNo required textbook or readings. \nNo coding assignments. \nGrades are not curved ( B >= 80, A >= 90 ). \nInstructor is very active in Piazza. \n\nHCI should be perfect for Summer. It can also be combined with another course with Low-to-Medium workload.",

However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him.

I work at a large company in a division that develops software, and learned much about what certain processes are, why we do things a particular way, alternatives that could be explored and areas that could be improved. The actual coding of the class project was beyond my technical capabilities without a lot of additional work, but fortunately some of my teammates were well versed in programming Java and Android, and I was able to pick up more/most of the work on the requirements and documentation side to make up for it, which obviously helped and felt like a fair distribution. You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault. Overall I highly recommend this class, even though it's not a killer I think everyone who doesn't have a highly detailed background in large-scale software development and management can benefit from it.",

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.",

First, the emulator used in this class is poorly documented and has weird behaviors that have to be taken into account to get correct results. Once I understood (read: got burned by) this, I spent more time in the projects trying to make sure that I didn't misunderstand how the emulator worked than I did actually doing the lab. The second part was that it was really hard to get a feel if your lab results were expected. It is structured so that you do the work and analyze the results. I ended up analyzing the \"wrong\" results and got double penalized (see point one). The TAs try to help with this, but they can't just come out and say whats wrong, so make sure that you read everyones notes to the TAs regarding the labs.

There's 30 hours of them, so keeping up week by week is important. Projects every 2 weeks will keep you busy. Projects 2, Hough spaces, and 7, particle filters, are the most time intensive. Looking back, my ability to write python/numpy code has improved over the semester and project 2 would take me half the time now as it did earlier on. \n\nComputer Vision draws from pieces of so many other topics. Kalman and particle filters are covered in AI4R, graph cut and probabilistic algorithms in CCA, and supervised and unsupervised learning from ML. All of these are used, just applied to images and video. So you may get more out of the class after taking a few other classes.

I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

There was a one hour midterm consisting of multiple choice and T/F style problems. I have yet to take the final, but it is 3 hours long, has a similar format and length to the midterm, and is comprehensive. We are permitted to use a single sheet of notes for the tests. \n\nThe material spends a lot of time focusing on definitions of terms, policies, and best practices. It uses common terminology, so much of it will be familiar, just applied to a new realm. The videos are high quality, easy to understand, and you can tell Professor Beyah was well rehearsed and polished for their production. There are a few moments where I felt like I was watching the Turbo Encabulator video, but it wasn't too terribly distracting. \n\nThe course also has some pacing issues. With only three short projects, straightforward material, two tests, and ~50 students this semester we probably won't get higher than 300 threads in Piazza. I think the inclusion of meatier projects / more projects is likely to occur, and would benefit the class. \n\nIf you are looking to prepare for the course, you could learn Wireshark if you don't already know how to use it, and potentially buy the books in advance and do some casual reading.",

            "text": "There were 6 assignments (4 individual and 2 group). Your overall grade is based on these assignments and class participation (completing all quizzes and actively on piazza). I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.",

This course was challenging without being too bad. Some weeks I spent 20-30 hours, some weeks less than 5. More of the former though. \n\nThere were 8 projects for 60% of your grade, which alternated between pretty challenging (coding wise) to more read/report which were interesting but easier. If you have a significant coding/Python background you have a big advantage, but otherwise they will push you. There is a lot of reading: academic papers, book, and background that took up a chunk of time I did not expect. \n\nThe course is a really good course, especially for a first one in OMSCS. Konte as a professor was great with feedback, Michael Brown as a head TA was great on that as well. The rest of the TAs, Michael, and Maria Konte were simply fantastic overall. Incredibly responsive on Piazza. \n\nThe tests are 40% of your grade. Although Test 1 was pretty random and not super representative of the material, Test 2 and Test 3 were much better - challenging but very fair.

One thing that impressed me the most was Thad spending 2. 5 hrs giving a walk through of midterm; something that we don't see too often by any Prof of that class & calibre (such things are generally dealt by the TAs). Almost all the TA's were highly motivated, fun to work with on assignments & were highly responsive on piazza (sometimes even on holidays) & the best part was they are all humble enough to learn from any occasional mistakes that happened in setting up assignments or questions in the exams. \nThe course is pretty loaded (especially if you are working fulltime). There are 6 assignments, 1 midterm & 1 final exam. The assigments were all challenging covering various areas of AI. This is my 4th course & clearly I've spent the most number of sleepless nights(almost) during this term :)\nBoth the midterm & the finals are open book format & we had a full week to submit. This meant the questions were pretty open ended & challenging. Found this format of exam very benefitial. Gives you an opportunity to review the material well before answering. For once, it felt like it was testing what you know and not the 2-3 closed book formats which was testing more of what we don't know/remember. \n\nOverall, I'll recommend the class highly if you wish to explore & know more of what AI, ML etc is all about...",

The grading is a little wonky, because only your best 5 assignments count, and your final grade is based only on your overall standing at the end of the class. Anything over the overall course mean was an A, and the B cutoff was generously below the mean. \n\nThe lectures are a patchwork of old content from Thrun and Norvig and some new modules with Starner; production value is good, but the new content is often superficial, and it seems to be read from a script. (I'm not saying I could do better, but there are better lectures in the OMS program at this point). \n\nContrary to other posters, I found this class to be a constant frustration. The projects were error-laden, and the staff participation on Piazza was below-average; however, office hours and instructor participation in the class were much better than other classes. The projects were not particularly difficult (similar to RL or CV), but there was not a single graded exercise this semester (assignment or exam) that didn't contain obvious mistakes/errors. Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not. \n\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn't always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems. I think the Bonnie servers are Udacity infrastructure shared by all GT classes that use the system, so large classes (6601 started with 400+ this term) and overlapping deadlines cause issues. \n\nGive it another couple semesters to work out the bugs before taking this one.",

I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired. It was all very interesting content to me, but it felt a bit shallow. \n\nI selected 6 hrs/week as an estimated average. Some weeks were heavier than others, and then there were weeks when I didn't really do much at all. The course was pretty easy, in my opinion.",

The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material.

As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb.",

The first project is relatively easy since it is mostly just figuring out R libraries. Part 2 takes longer if you really try to apply everything including things that may not have been covered yet. Make sure you just plan accordingly and don't wait until the last moment for things. That is the only time you will really run into trouble. \n\nOverall, I thought this would give more industry experience given that Prof Lebanon has worked at a variety of large companies. I think I learned more from other students who were nice enough to post explanation than I did from the professor. I would also recommend getting The Elements of Statistical Learning as an alternate reference for this course since there is little reference material provided. Also, brush up on linear algebra and calculus before you get to logistic regression.",

I studied for about 4 hours, compiled the slides, and hadn't watched the lectures in weeks, but still managed an 82. There were a whole bunch of questions that I easily could have gotten if I spent the time to re-watch all the lectures. \nOverall, I really enjoyed the class and the output from the later projects is really cool. \nDefinitely spend time getting to know python and numpy. Being able to run your code efficiently can change your runtime from hours to minutes or seconds.

Three project reflections, three assignments on nothing related to the class, a midterm and a final. Totally 15, 000+ words on the minimum, and if you want to secure a good grade, at least 20, 000. \nThis not only became a drain, but a bother to complete. \nThe lectures had little to do with the class, and the depth was nonexistent. I feel that I learned little, while just enjoying the programming and creativity. \nHowever, the TAs were lenient in grading and very understanding. As a whole, we started to somewhat complain that our midterm and final essays were high level architectures with little value, so they offered an alt-final, where students could develop their midterm NLP chatbot design into a real program, I can't image many other teachers agreeing to offer a second final for students who didn't feel they were learning enough.

P4 is also pretty neat as it revolves around internet security exploits. \n\nOverall workload for this class is pretty manageable. 5-10 hours a week. One major help is the bonus project, which can add 10% to your grade. This can cancel out a bad project or two if you need it (projects were 15% of our grade, tests 10%). \n\nThe downside during Fall 2016 semester was inattentive TAs. Our third project was released two weeks late due to all the TAs forgetting about it. It's likely that the professor will be more active due to this management gap in future semesters, so I wouldn't worry about it in the future. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this course.

The projects (with the possible exception of project 2) are well done and very helpful to understanding concepts. \n\nThe style of the exams was multiple-guess and fill in the blank, timed, proctored (ProctorTrack), taken through T-Square. The questions needed some improvement, though. Some of the questions are a bit nit-picky, and some are written in such a way that I spent more time debating the intent of the question than figuring out the answer. \n\nAs for workload, the projects consumed most of the time I spent on the course. When I was working on a project I might spend 20+ hours a week on the class. Otherwise it was less than 10. To be successful on the projects I'd recommend starting early, being comfortable writing C in a \nLinux environment, using the command line, and debugging with GDB. \n\nLast, don't cheat. One of the TAs mentioned that they caught something like 10% of our class cheating on the projects. That's ridiculous. Start early, keep at it, and hit the Slack channel when you get stuck. You can survive a bad grade on a project but a course F due to cheating might end your time in the program. Don't be dumb.",

The lectures are a combination of old videos by Norvig/Thrun and new content by Thad Starner and head TA Shelly Baghi. The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book. They each took about 10 hours to complete and motivated you to consult the book/lectures to fully understand the topics before committing to an answer. \n\nOn average I spent about 10 hours per week on the class (counted by Toggl) but by no means it's an easy class.

I found that if you want to learn the subject, it is a much better use of your time to review the 'optional' reading. \nProject - Based on solving the RPM problems, split into 3 iterations. Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)",

It is all C programming and I've never done C, so there was some growing pains in the beginning. I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well. You could know the concepts yet still do poorly on the exam. Also the midterm only covered a small portion of the material.... and that left the majority of the material for the final. And that was a lot to study!\n\nNow the best thing about this class was actually the unofficial slack channel. The TAs hung out on there and were so active, always responding to questions, carrying on discussion of concepts... I do wish I run into more classes with TAs like these. \n\nThe worst thing is the amount of people that thought they could get away with cheating in this class. The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many. It's unfortunate that so much of their time and effort had to go into something that shouldn't happen, instead of on grading and improving projects. Be a considerate person, don't cheat.",

That means that in order to actually get through the projects, you pretty much have to go out and learn some pretty difficult material by yourself without any instructor support. With better instructors and projects that better mapped to the lectures, this could have been a really great course.

I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor.",

It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class.",

Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

The reason that you will love it is because you will employ mathematics like you never did before in real practice. You will hate it because you will see lot of mathematics which requires a very deep understanding of linear algebra. I mean real understanding of what matrices are, not just knowing the definitions or tricks to solve them. You will love professor Bobick and his humor during the lectures. His lectures were very useful to simplify things, and you won't appreciate his excellent explanation unless you try to read a CV book. I must admit, I didn't fully understand all the math behind many topics but I fully understood the intuition behind them. The beauty of this course is that you will have 8 problem sets which will teach the course literally. I enjoyed every problem set from 1 to 8. The only trivial one was PS1, but all subsequent problem sets will require many many hours of hard work. After this course, you will appreciate math and what it can do for you, appreciate ML and will strive to take any course related to it. In my opinion, this reflects the success of this course generally. If anyone want to take this course, then prepare yourself with enough Python knowledge and linear algebra since you will need them. Also, start any problem set as soon as you can and always check Piazza and slack group since you will find great community who will help and encourage you. I'm happy that I've taken this course as my first course since I've learned many great things and it also gave me enough enthusiasm energy to explore more about ML. Take this course and you won't regret it",

Then the class ends with a larger project that definitely requires you to comprehend and do research beyond what was covered in the lectures. You can work alone or in groups up to four. I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it. There was also an extra credit option where you actually build a robot and implement some of the ideas of the course, though unfortunately I did not get time to engage with that aspect of the course. \n\nCompared to other classes this one had a less interaction with staff or other students, perhaps because enrollment is smaller and there were less assignments. The instructors were not particularly active on Piazza. There were three office hours which were constantly rescheduled and even with few Piazza posts there was often slow turnaround for responses.

The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks.

            "text": "Hmm, interesting course overall - in the end, I got the A I wanted but my brutally honest assessment of myself is that I didn't earn that A. In terms of the R programming side of the course, I use R on a daily basis at work so the assignments were a breeze. The projects were cool and make the student think and formulate informed hypotheses about the data. Based on my own grades, I felt like some parts of the project (the second project in particular) were graded too leniently (i. e., some parts where I felt I put \"adequate\" answers, but nowhere near the best answer or result possible, I still got full marks). \n\nThe final was baffling (in terms of the grade I got on it). My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record. Given that, it remains to be seen how generously this course will be graded in the future.",

            "text": "I was hoping to get a glimpse into modern software architecture and design techniques, but instead, I got UML. In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of \"busy work\" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious. \n\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn't help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn't need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it. \n\nThe lectures weren't particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn't feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed *all* the assignments (only to get the participation points). In the end, it was a very average course for me. Not particularly bad, but not great either.",

Here's the breakdown of assignments:\n\n10 quizzes - these are all easy and straight from the book and some lectures. Mostly quizzing you on definitions and a few characteristics of certain ideas. Very few times will you find a \"gotcha\" type of question here. \n\n4 Projects - Project 1 was a stack overflow exploit in C. I was new to both C and this type of attack so there were some growing pains here (plenty of resources online). Project 2 I had a blast with, we analyzed malware running on VMs. Project 3 was about decrypting keys using Python. This was a lot of fun even though the grading came back less than I expected, probably my favorite project I've done in this program. Project 4 was all about using Javascript to exploit XSS attacks. The gotchas in this project were a bit rough for me but I got graded really well. \n\n2 Exams (not open book/notes) - It seems that most of these questions came from different places from the text and lectures. At times they could seem like really minute details for questions but it is what it is. If I were to have to do this class over I would go through all the lectures and take notes. This would have helped me a lot. Also the proctoring was a hassle for some students (I had no issues). \n\nExtra credit project - this is offered to give you an additional 10 points to your final grade. Unfortunately part of one of the extra credit projects is totally a \"get all the points or none\" kind of or deal. Seems like an odd format for students who need additional help. \n\nOverall you should get a decent-good grade in this course. I enjoyed it and at times wish I could have focused more on certain aspects of InfoSec. A whole course on network security, or malware, or decryption would be a ton of fun! I recommend this course to anyone, just do a better job of taking lecture notes than I did.",

Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams.

So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL). And then you get dinged for that (for something you were never taught to begin with!). \n\n5) Absentee professor. Professor doesn't teach this course.

It is well designed and executed, touching on a variety of very fundamental CS concepts that are relevant to many other courses in the program. The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren't strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A. \n\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst. The grading for this one also struck me as strange. I see the point(s) that the project was trying to convey, but think that it could be accomplished better in a different format.",

Prof. Vuduc is an amazing professor, and I found the concepts fascinating. If you're not coming from a CS background, I would strongly recommend doing some prep work on C and parallel algorithms.

There were 8 projects in total. The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor. Then you can go over the test prep questions and solutions that were also provided. The professor was good about including the topics you should look over to be successful on the exams.",

In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course's exams. I did not like the fact that the course's exams only focus on arithmetic even though it is at a graduate level.",

Try your best on each problem and then look up the student answer on Piazza. This is probably the best approach to learning how to do these kind of problems. \n\nThere was an exam every 3 weeks (5 exams total) and these exams only covered the past three weeks of material plus we got a \"retry\" question from the previous exam. So each exam had one question for each week of material plus one optional retry question which covered a topic students did poorly on for the previous exam. I never did the retry question so that I could have more time to work on the required 3 problems for the exam. You have 2 hours for the exam, you also were allowed a one page handwritten note sheet for the exams. \n\nYou will need the famous CLRS textbook as well as the Intro to the Theory of Computation book by Sipser. Both books are pretty good. \n\nProfessor Pryby made some very helpful supplemental videos and office hours videos to go with the legacy Udacity videos from the previous course professor (I think his name was Charlie). \n\nOverall I prefer \"code slinging\" over theory, but this class was a good change of pace (6th OMSCS course for me).",

The bad news is that one of the TA's did not do a good job of interacting with students on Piazza: some questions were ignored, some were marked as answered but still ignored, some were answered with short unhelpful responses (even condescending ones), and maybe 25% got useful answers. There were also a couple issues with mistakes on assignment and project requirements (incorrect assumptions and documentation, missing or incorrect files, etc. ) that didn't get addressed until just before the due dates. If you work hard in this class you will do a lot better than you might feel like you are doing due to the frustrations with trying to get questions answered and clarify buggy requirements.

The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA's credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date). \n\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final. \n\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts. But yes - in the end, you're interpreting thousands of lines of code and changing 10 of them. \n\nI think the biggest problem is that the subject matter was just too academic for me to relate to in terms of generating excitement.

I've never worked with C professionally, just a few semesters on my undergrad. As a professional Java developer working for quite time, I found the projects hard but really interesting to do. If you are a developer you will find your way. It took me the first project me to adapt to the \"C\" style. Used and abused of logs in my code.

They are there to make you succeed! So if you work hard you will get there... \nA few things to improve:\n - Project 2 descriptions are ambiguous. Although its meant to be straightforward, the way the questions / possible answers are written were confusing. \n- I found exams to be overvalued. 55% for 2 exams are too much compared to the project's workload. \nOverall I learned a lot enough to improve my developer experience.

I ended up spending an enormous amount of extra time coding this as a few team members did very little and one did absolutely nothing until the day it was due. Due to it, our project ended up being way less than it should have been and felt that our TA was pretty nice to us given the circumstances. With that said I put a ton of hours into it and was very frustrated with how it turned out because of this. Still did get an A which makes me feel a bit better about this but in some ways not happy that the guy who did almost nothing probably also got an A.

There is no real videos as it is all about the conversations hence the didn't read above. Also, I think the Peer Reviews were mostly crap as most didn't really provide any input anyway. I always did but others just did an exercise instead of a way to help others. The project itself was incredibly open ended and the meat of the class. I thought there were alot of useless projects people took on, however, it might have just been hard to come up with ideas. Here is where you can get a lot or a little out of the class. The TAs and Dave are here to help you in this open ended way. The class is an easy A but it is what you make out of it. You can learn a lot or a little but depends on you. Interesting concept for a class (being lecture less) and has merit. Grading of a class like this does require a finesse which I am thinking is a little lacking at moment. Overall, a fantastic class by a fantastic instructor and would recommend. If nothing else to get use to how upper academia is done. My criticism is just to let people know what they are getting.

Many times, the exam questions tended to be very similar to some of the problem set questions. \n- Don't feel bad if you are not able to solve the pre-requisite questions.

However, I ended up doing quite well in the course. \n- 5 tests actually made it easier as each week, we just had to master 3 different topics. There was no cumulative final. \n- Join the slack group. You don't need to be active, but do keep an eye out on the discussions.

My major difficulty with this class was the sheer amount of material, and the grading structure. 50% of the class was assignments, while the other 50% was tests. I did well on all of the assignments and met or exceeded the class average on the tests and still ended up with a B.

I learned stuff and more importantly felt confident about getting back to school and taking harder courses. \n\nThere was a lot of gripe from people in the class about how easy the course was and I can see how it might have been. So if you are programming/scripting for work and are not looking for class fillers, please don't bother taking this course. These reviews exist for a reason",

It has no tests, but focuses on a semester-long project that has various design and implementation phases. You will have to make a few UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, etc), write requirements, and develop the designed project in Java. \n\nIf you already have experience with Java, and are familiar with Object-Oriented concepts, this course won't really be hard at all. If you aren't very experienced with programming in general, I feel that this is a nice starting point to practice these concepts and learn in a very practical way. \n\nThe only downside were the lectures, which I didn't find too interesting, nor did they help me too much with the project per-se, except for a few ones that talk about UML Class Diagrams and others that talk about converting requirements to classes and methods. \n\nIn summary, this is a good starting point if you aren't too experienced with programming. If you are, but want to start off the OMSCS with a not-too-difficult class just to get an idea of how the whole program runs, this is a good option as well. However, I wouldn't suggest it to an experienced software engineer. For those students, there are other courses in the OMSCS that would teach them more useful things.",

You will not be able to do the assignment the night before (trust me, I tried and got burned once). Also, give a good amount of attention and time to the midterm and final. I failed to think the midterm would be as long as the assignments as I was wrong. Many of the polls stated people spent well over 20 hours on the midterm. Also, be sure to understand the grading structure as I completely missed the ball on that. For my semester, it was a curve where everyone above the mean got an A and the professor separated the class on two curves for on campus vs online (which was a point of contention for most but was explained with good reason as on campus had additional time & resources and the means were statistically different to show for it. )\n\nBest of luck in the class and hope you stick through the pain and relish in the accomplishment when you are done.",

You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary.

It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts.

It felt very rough - there's little lecture and many assignments required considerable time searching the web to figure out things you needed that weren't in the class material. Students found the assignments ambiguous, and piazza questions were answered very slowly and not in a clear manner. The original professor, Dr. Lebanon, was swapped out for Dr. Chakraborty and I just felt he wasn't really prepared for the class. Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

The instructor, Maria Konte, was new and stayed in the background until near the end, but TA team was great and the head TA Michael was a superstar so the class moved along like clockwork, with assignments coming back regularly and useful feedback. Some projects were a bit raw out of the gate - fortunately, the students on Piazza were very helpful in finding and fixing issues to keep things moving. Don't be fooled by the early reviews - it's not an easy class, it has morphed to be about medium difficulty and time - but it is predictable and well-tuned.",

TAs are very lazy and don't answer the questions or answered in a very misleading way. Then at grading stage, they will surprise you and interpret the question in a different way it is being asked, and deduct points from the students. A few classic examples: 1. what is the growth rate of different format of file size? (They graded with big(O) notation) 2. Describe your observation (grading notes released after three weeks of submission saying, you can't say A is bigger than B, you have to say A is 4% and B is 3%, so A is bigger than B). The answer is in the figure the students submit, but the reason most of us didn't put them in the final conclusion is the assignment didn't ask it in the beginning. \nDefinitely the worst course have been seen in OMSCS",

I had to withdraw since my first midterm grade was very poor and the instructor had no intentions of giving a curve even though the class average was failing! Nobody got an A on the first exam and the exam did a poor job of gauging my understanding of the material since it was all T/F questions with 3 ineligible Multiple choice questions (we could not see the diagrams properly). Despite all of the students complaints, the instructors simply ignored them and moved on. On top of that, we never even got the answer key for the first exam so I don't know what I got wrong (or could argue for any points back). \n\nThe mini projects could be fun; however, the lectures do not show how to solve them at all. I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class. It is sad because the material looks so cool but the lack of structure, direction, and overall unfairness of this class has lead me to believe that this is the worst class I have ever taken as a student (and this was my 8th class in the program).",

The assignments and class lectures loosely fit together, but not well. \nAs for the exams, the mid-term was open book, but the material on the actual midterm exam did not match that covered in the provided practice midterm, nor in the office hours \"midterm review\" sessions. Granted, you were given 3 hrs to complete the midterm, but when the average grade was somewhere between 27-32 out of 50, something is just not right. \nI decided to drop the course after lack-luster performance on the midterm as well as several assignments, also after asking professor / TAs for help or clarification. The assignments and midterm were returned with virtually no explanation of what was done wrong, making learning from mistakes difficult at best.

You're provided with a scanner that gives you a tagged token stream and you have to write a top-down, table-driven parser, modify the grammar to make it LL(1) or as close as you can get, and produce four-address code that assumes unlimited registers as an intermediate representation. In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance. \n\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself. As it is a table-driven parser, your best bet is to write a code-generator that parses your grammar spec and creates the table, which is what something like yacc or ANTLR does, but you're not allowed to use those and have to write your own parser generator. \n\nThere is also a written homework every few weeks, similar to CCA in that you need to answer some think-cases, but much easier in that you’re just working through existing algorithms, not devising your own and proving they work. There is also a comprehensive final. \n\nAlthough it’s a first run, the course feels like a finished product. It is very well-run with clear requirements and the material is fantastic. Be prepared to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to get a working product unless you’ve done this before, but it is well worth it and extremely satisfying to see your baby in the wild. You’ll leave with the know-how to create your own basic programming language.",

GaTech couldn't find a professor to teach so they made Arpana Chakraborty, a Udacity course developer/instructor as an adjunct lecturer to teach under the GaTech brand. In his own words, \"I apologize for being absent for the past couple of weeks; I've been busy with work outside of this class\", excuse me? He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade. One big reason I join OMSCS was to avoid this kind of teaching. GaTech needs to evaluate the staff carefully to uphold and preserve the integrity of this program. I suggest the staff take the playbook from other courses like ML4T or CP or KBAI for future version of this course.",

The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late.

There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying.

I know that some will say it is not the student's role but the methodology of going above and beyond has worked well in this program. \n\nOne of the main issues this class had was amount of contradicting information given many times. In several occasions it was mentioned to us that the TAs had a hard time reaching the professor when asked to clarify. \n\nThe staff in this class needs to be evaluated. It was evident the TAs don't talk to each other and a few do not know how to handle students' queries.

However the tone and level of sarcasm used in (their) posts came out as confrontational. You are an instructor and if you are part of the team that answers the forums you need to work on your communicational skills! If you are frustrated, take a break and answer a post in a couple of hours or take a walk before answering!\n\nAs a side note, there is a review here that claims the professor was blaming the TAs for \"dropping the ball\", That is not true, it was a TA that said that. \n\nTL;DR: Wait for this class to be reviewed by GT!",

Too much of ambiguity, too much of (needless) load, makes learning second priority., e. g. Use of loops, run it 5 times, 10 times, 500 times, sorta questions, asking Complexity, No doubt this is essentials, but DVA is not meant for that. \nAnd cryptic messages for communication, asking TA's Or Prof. question over piazza or slack, u get very terse/generic feedback. I just couldn't realize Did TA/Prof. wanted to remove ambiguity or add to it. Like any stupid student I dared sometime, to re-ask the next question, to get No further reply. \nSome of my Piazza posts remained, unanswered. If I pass this course, it would be because of my own work and students who were active and prompt on piazza. \nNewly hired Prof. n TA's, Couldn't make this course interesting, neither they could make us realize potential of the course. Project/Assignment grading took forever, Course is about to finish, and we're yet \nto get feedback for half of our work. \nWith all due respect, I really doubt their credentials, to carry on, GT plz review this staff. \nDespite student asking for ideal answers, we never got any positive feedback on it. Grading is generous at times, but, rather than that, I'd prefer, what went wrong and how can I improve it. \nOhh, and how can we forget, TA Jiachen Yang's epic sarcasm.

I have never written Java, never been exposed to unit testing, heard of UML but never messed with it. I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily.

Unfortunately for me, my reading comp is not what it used to be!!\n\nThe projects were great at demonstrating the subject material. However, from a non-CS background, they were INCREDIBLY (for me) time consuming, and occasionally frustrating. However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS.

Tough to do for 500 students, especially when the prof was frequently absent or seemingly unreachable. \n\nRegarding curriculum only (in hopes of logistical improvement for future course iterations): I don't come from a math background, and could have brushed up on calculus before enrolling. I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data.

You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked. It made the whole semester feel disorganized. For example, the instructors didn't post anything about the first exam until 2-3 days before it opened. Makes studying pretty hard.

For me I was introduced to these concepts the first time, and hence it was very time consuming to learn to think in terms of ML concepts. Projects are hard only because its vague interms of grading and open-ended-ness. This is not a bad thing, I actually liked this approach, but since its my first time, a lot of time spent is to learn to think in terms of ML. I read all the papers and most of Tom Mitchell's book - prescribed by the TAs. They are very useful to understand these concepts. One thing is assured - all this effort will not go to waste. Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA. While all those courses are good in their own way, CS7641 really dives inside the different ML algorithms. For those interested in pursuing ML this is must take.",

I had completed half of the labs prior to taking the course and have taken all other ML / data courses in the program, so the machine learning and general data concepts weren't extremely challenging. The catch, though, was trying to drink from a fire hose in order to complete the homework assignments. The challenge w/ the assignments was picking up Scala, working with provided virtualized / containerized environments (for Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Zeppelin, etc. ) that weren't fully functional or compatible with the requirements of the assignment. Get ready to troubleshoot the tools you're given. \n\nThe instructor and TA were not at all very interactive on Piazza. IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early).",

Two of the projects involved recreating results from academic papers. In addition, it is recommended that students read through 22 academic papers throughout the course. While you can survive the course without reading most of the academic papers, it shows where the focus is. \n\nHomework felt completely unrelated to lecture material, the time needed to do homework assignments varied wildly and some of the homework and project timelines were unrealistic unless you can stay way ahead of schedule. \n\nOverall, the course felt in some ways like a disservice to the material it covers. The course material is interesting and can be used to solve very cool problems like those seen on OpenAI, however it only spent a small portion of the time solving interesting problems.",

Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort. I imagine it will provide a good head start for the CV course, but I have not taken that... yet!",

This course, arguably, has the lowest percentage of \"A\" among all the OMSCS courses. The exam questions are purposely tricky. There were four exams in total, the grade mediums are below 80 (out of 100) except one exam. Though my grades are 2~4 sd higher than the medium, but I do not believe that tricky questions are good to motivate studies. Another thing I would approach differently is the course content, instead of emphasizing on EER diagram which is essentially a formalization to represent information, I prefer to dig deeper in more practical issues, e. g., query performance optimization, normalization, or non-SQL database. In addition, I suggest to remove exam #3 for SQL and move the questions to other exams, there are so many moving parts in the course, which makes it hard to follow. \n\nIn the group project, we were asked to build a fully functional web application with a database back-end.

I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests.

Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester). Like most classes, you get out of it what you put into it.",

            "text": "This class was one of the most challenging, yet rewarding classes I’ve ever taken. I took an automata & complexity class in undergrad, but taking this class gave me a much greater appreciation for algorithms and the theory of computing. Despite its storied history and monstrous reputation, this class seems to have improved to the point of being one of the best classes in the program (I’ve taken 9 so far), so it’s a shame that it’s being replaced – hopefully Graduate Algorithms will be just as successful as this has been the past couple of semesters. This class was divided into three sections: algorithms (9 weeks, 3 exams), computability (3 weeks, 1 exam), complexity (3 weeks, 1 exam)\n\nSome of the bad things were still there: the Udacity videos were largely useless; I dreaded having to watch these, and was thankful for the weeks that the instructor posted new videos on YouTube that aligned more with GA. I was also able to understand material much better by just reading Sipser and CLRS and watching MIT’s OpenCourseware and UC Davis’ equivalents of the material. Having problem sets assigned solely as preparation for the five exams (each worth 20%) was great. We could propose solutions on Piazza and have TA’s or the instructor Chris Pryby (who were fantastic, btw) respond and give us hints and feedback. Tests were difficult, but fair, and there were opportunities to make up for some lost points on previous exams. No doubt the material is hard and might take some students a few semesters to get an A or B (particularly ones that have never seen the material before), but this is one class that I would recommend to anyone seeking a Master’s degree in this program.",

While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn’t come until the latter third of the class. I’ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I’ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material.",

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future. I am proceeding under the assumption the professor will take CIOS feedback to heart. But if he doesn't, I would avoid his classes in the future.",

It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity.

I learned a lot, and enjoyed the class overall. \n\nThe tests were pretty rough though. I got a high A on every project, but struggled to make two C's and a B on the tests even when studying a lot. The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don't think the tests did a good job judging whether you'd learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember. \n\nOne big warning, I think they've revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There's some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don't get much of a break. \n\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don't think that's true anymore. I'd say this class is relatively *tractable* in the sense that if you can put in the time to memorize all the papers you read, and put in enough time on the individual projects, you have a very good chance of earning an A.

Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer. \n\nOn the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent \"quizzes\" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you. \n\nToo often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you. When it was time for a project, it was like being sat at the controls for one of the giant mixers or something, told to push the red button, and write down how much chocolate comes out. \n\nI scored over a 100 (due to extra credit), but still I wish I could have a do-over and take something else instead.",

Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code. Also, Dr. Pryby and the TAs were responsive, fair, helpful, and awesome.",

But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really? I got As on the first two but a C on the final, so maybe they were adjusting the difficulty as they went along.

But I acted like they didn't exist except the few times I had a specific question, and I suspect my learning suffered for it. \n\nThe lectures comprise the bulk of the learning material, along with journal articles assigned for most lectures. Most of those aren't too difficult, skewing towards older and easier to digest articles. Ada's a great lecturer and I have few complaints about the quality of the lessons. The recurring \"toyshop\" metaphor felt like a gimmick and wasn't particularly edifying, however. Some of the topics chosen were a little mysterious -- it's unclear to me how remote procedure calls, for example, are a good topic for an OS fundamentals class. \n\nYou'll spend most of your time on the projects. If you know any C at all they shouldn't be too difficult... though through a combination of poor planning and lapses in intelligence I couldn't figure out the synchronization necessary for Project 3 and received an extremely low score. Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class. I'll likely get a B, but if I'd applied myself a little better an A would have been achievable. More importantly, I've grasped the fundamentals well enough to have a base for continued learning.

If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone.

My recommendation for students is to start the labs early, check the piazza discussions daily, and try to squeeze every possible point out of the labs, particularly if there is any extra credit available. \n\nMy recommendation for the instructors (should they happen to read this) is that I found Unit 3 and lab 5 a bit esoteric and not particularly valuable. I would have preferred that Unit 2, which is on distributed memory systems, be expanded and include more challenging labs, possibly a Cartesian finite volume solver of some kind. \n\nOverall it was a fantastic course, and I definitely learned a lot.",

This included an absent instructor, a sarcastic TA, vague/contradicting assignment instructions, and extremely late grade returns. I (wisely) withdrew from the course the day before the deadline because I could not handle the stress. I regretted my decision at first, but the class did not get any better. Some say it got worse. I know this because I kept up with it on Slack and Piazza. All this being said, I feel like I would have gotten an A or a B in the course had I kept with it, but it would have put too much of a strain on my mental state. \n\nThe content itself is genuinely useful and interesting. I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate. Many of the people \"complaining\" (including myself) have successfully completed many OMSCS courses without the kinds of issues experienced in this class.",

But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions. It all works, but it's a bit duct-taped together. \n\nOverall a continually fun and interesting class with phenomenal instructor involvement.",

It is a lot of material and overall it is very interesting. The grading was fair and was based on 3 projects and 2 tests. \n\nThe tests were short, multiple choice and T/F tests. In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns. Since the class grading involved only 5 assignments Piazza was quiet most of the semester. \n\nI would like to see this class improve since the material is current and well-delivered.

ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

First three and last two projects required some programming in Python and I didn't find the coding hard. The remaining three projects were spoon fed through instructions and their main goal was to analyze the results and write reports. Tests included short answer and multiple choice questions and I found the difficulty level to increase from test 1 to test 3.

They don't teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what's on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don't have supporting materials. If you google it, it's hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references. \n2. The assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It's hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot. \n3. The exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn't not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50. You do the math. \n4. TA's are very active and very friendly, professor only showed up a couple of times in office hours. \nIn conclusion, it's a hard class because of the way it is taught, barely covering topics and expecting from you to become an expert. Be careful if you are going to take this course.",

As long as you follow instructions, the grading isn't very strict. This class pairs well with other classes, though be aware that the workload during the month or so of the group project can be higher than for typical weeks. Professor Orso and the TAs were very involved and helpful. My main complaint was that the pace of grading was pretty slow.",

You mostly get student feedback, which I thought was often polarized and rarely educational. (I do like the student feedback aspect though - very unique. ) Going back to the project, I felt that getting a high score by any means necessary was the way to get points, then you rationalize your approach with AI language. I tried to use lesson concepts initially and got mediocre results, but I felt that I learned a lot. Then I realized I wasn't playing the same game everyone else was and adopted more productive methods, but less AI-ish, so to speak. So, in the end, I liked the class, but did not love it.",

During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing. \n\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up. You will ultimately learn only what you choose to learn. If you want an easy A you could likely get that done, but honestly it would be a waste if you don't use the opportunity to push yourself.",

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

But, the readings are great if you have time to read them. The topics are relevant to today's cyber security environment and also covers recent research in this area. Some papers go really in depth in the topic like how DNS works, etc. You also learn to use machine learning to check for network anomaly and then to bypass it which is cool. Assignments can be annoying since they require specific answers to the questions. Some assignments took more than 40+ hours to complete due to this. I suggest instructors to make the assignment more flexible and grading flexible too. If you want to learn in this course you will (provided you do the readings and assignments) and if you want to just pass it you can (but may not learn much!)",

If you're coming in with some knowledge of Python and Linear Algebra, then I would say you can put it in 10 hours per week, get most of the knowledge out of the class, and walk away with a solid B. But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time. The grading structure is designed such that each homework assignment has an \"Above and Beyond\" section that counts for 10%, so to get anything higher than a 90, you'll need to develop something beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. Personally I enjoyed this a lot, but it's clear that a lot of others didn't. \n\nThis class is being redesigned over the Summer, so I don't know if any of this will hold true in the Fall though. Overall I had a great time, but for the future I hope the instructors make the writeups shorter and the coding more challenging. \n\nEdit: Also definitely do the readings! They are absolutely fascinating! But don't worry about fully understanding all of the math for each reading - you just need to get the gist of them.",

For me, this also meant that I was unable to fully absorb lots of the concepts. The lectures are just \"ok\" in my opinion. In many sections the math is glossed over, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nThe \"Above and Beyond\" portion of the grading seemed rather arbitrary and subjective to me. For one assignment, I didn't even attempt the extra 10% and inexplicably got a 94 on the assignment. On the other hand, there were other assignments that I put 8-10 extra hours in and only received 1 or 2 points. Overall the process was extremely variable. Lots of it seemed like it depended on the TA you got and what mood he or she was in that day. \n\nMy biggest beef with this class was the final exam. This was unproctored and open-everything. This sounds great, but in practice it meant a bunch of questions with tricky wording. Even that wouldn't have been bad, but tricky questions were combined with poorly worded questions, making it hard to determine a question's intent. The final basically devolved into a digital scavenger hunt. I don't think it measured my knowledge of the material at all-- just how well I could use Ctrl+F. \n\nOverall this was a decent course. The homework is interesting and can be time consuming, so possibly try to take it on it's own.",

After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment.",

I would not say it was Maths heavy but it does require brushing up some basics and keeping them handy for proofs/calculations throughout the course. Prof. Pryby's youtube video lectures helped a lot during the initial part of the course. Video lectures on Udacity were dreadful. As the course progressed, I got a hang of things. Like others have stated, working on problem sets helped prepare for the exams. No matter how hard I prepared for all the 5 exams, I never felt confident before, after and during the exam, infact I always felt like I was going to fail. I somehow maintained 9s and 10s out of 15 throughout, which got me a B towards the end. It took me 4 tests to finally get a 5/5 on a question. I have to say that there were several moments where I felt like giving up, but I held on.

While it isn't a difficult class, I thought is was challenging enough and really required you to learn a wide variety of topics related to security. It is a lab/project driven class, so you will spend a lot of time working on projects. If you complete all the assignments and take the extra credit test, you should get a good grade. The lectures are simple and short, but it you really want to learn a topic you will need to complete the readings. While it did suffer some \"new class\" organization issues (it is only the second semester offered), it looks like the professor and TA's are really working to clean up these issues. Overall I think it is a good class to take, especially if you are looking for hands on experience in the network security area.",

People also struggled with selecting technical indicators. Just don't over-complicate things.

(The only thing that bothered me was one of the fonts used - a carbon copy of my former employers' corporate typeface that initially triggered some PTSD. ) The exams are open notes, so the quality of your own notes is very important if you want to do well on the exam. I still had to go back and watch lectures for a few questions, but having structured notes made it easy to quickly find that specific lecture. \n\nEach week had individual assignments which usually take 3-4 hours if you want to do a good job and earn an A. There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course. Since user-centric design principles focus on receiving feedback to inform iteration and continuous improvement, it's no surprise he does the same for his courses.",

This was not what I was expecting/wanting from this course; I previewed the remaining course materials and decided that this course wasn't really going to be applicable to my interests/career. I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers.

I'd love to see how to properly code some of the solutions to the projects, but I'll never see how to do it because the course organizers are too concerned with plagiarism in future classes. So I'm left at the end of the semester with an 'A' grade and a whole bunch of shitty code that works only half the time. I took off a few extra stars for the disorganization of the projects. Again, this seems to be the hallmark of a Georgia Tech course, where requirements constantly change right up to the deadline. Even when the requirements are finalized, we often couldn't submit until just before the deadline. \n\nPerhaps worst of all was the culture of Piazza during the term. Maybe we were just unlucky to have a high proportion of meanies in the class, but towards the end of term the forum mostly became a place to belittle other students, which culminated in a big, ugly, piazza fight. This kind of behavior was not discouraged by the TAs or the professor.",

The course covers all compilers phases. Lectures are crystal clear. Professor has been very committed to the office hours (weekly), open to different types of question. TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended.",

Point of perspective, the whole Deep Mind / Alpha Go think is built on top of the content of (RL). In general though, there is no teaching and it's more like a sink or swim class, more like you are generally expected to know the content up front (90%) and the remaining should be easily learnable. I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all. I made it, but the way the course is structured made it a lot more difficult than it should be. \n\nNegatives:\nToo many lecture readings per week. Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down. Who really has time to watch 3+ hours of lectures a week. Streamline to 1-2 hours. \n\nPositives:\nTA hands on sessions are useful. \nProject's content are really interesting. \n\nIn general, the course has potential. The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none. HWs need to be revamped to intro to a project, example, a HW could be done on linear programming with probabilities as a trivial example as basically project 3 that's all it's about.",

On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss.

Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes.

The problem is that the course is a long, extensive enumeration of a bunch of things that you should memorize (snooze-triggering videos on the details of various protocols used in industrial control systems) and then the exams do a very poor job in measuring the extent to which you've absorbed that information. So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well. I just finished the final in less than three minutes, having settled on an end goal of getting over half of the T/F questions correct for a B (the A being unattainable or not worth it due to crap questions).

However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

It is possible to front load things early on, which is a HUGE plus to me. \n\nNOTE: a review below says you have to fill out your own application to an IRB, that is not true.

Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format.

On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes. As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles. \n\n5. ) I learned nothing.

I took 30+ and almost 40 hours for project 2 and project 3. You need run some jobs. and it may take a one day, sometimes two days. Also, you need better computer with GPU. Please buy a computer with GPU. It really helps a lots. \n\nAlso there are lots of papers need read. Some video I did not understand, I watched David Silver (youtube version RL Course by David Silver) or Andrew Ng (youtube version from lesson 16 to lesson 20) first. then watch video again. it helps a lot. But for summer, it was short time. and if you had full time job. I think you need sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 AM for paper and video. and get up at 7:00 AM for job from Monday to Friday. and no weekends, because you need finish your HWs or Projects every weeks. So i think no life if you plan to take this course at summer. BTW, TA is best. helpful and very great.",

The professor and TAs are good about making sure you know the expectations for the class, that you keep your scope for you project reasonable, and that you are roughly on track throughout the course. If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines.",

They did not care to teach, or even fix their own issues on their assignments. Many times, questions students had were usually responded with \"read the writeup again\" (that was NOT clear at ALL, hence the flood of questions) or even in one case \"do not ask questions or you will get a honor code violation\". \n\nI was not active on the slack channel, but I can assure you that the professor never commented once in Piazza. I just did a search to be sure, and NOTHING showed up.

They connect very well to the lectures. \n\n3 projects (15% each). 6 home works (5% each). 1 final (25%). \n\nIt's a ton of work for the summer. It's a grind with something due every week. Even if you're ahead you'll get behind with the projects. You should definitely take ML before this. If not, you're in for a party. Highly recommend folks getting familiar with Barto and Sutton's book (it's free on Sutton's website), David Silver's RL lectures (YouTube), and numpy (vectorization for the win). \n\nHW 1-4, Project 1-2, and the final are fair and very related to the content (project 2 is awesome). HW 5-6 and Project 3 need to be reworked. HWs 5-6 are relatively easy, but are 'eh. ' Project 3 is a massive step up in complexity with little resources available if you don't 'get it. ' They were such an adrenaline kill after how great project 2 was. It sounds like the TAs are going to review and revamp. \n\nIsbell was absent, which was not a surprise due to past reviews. He was on piazza day 1, and that's essentially it. He missed the one office hour he was going to attend due to a storm. \n\nTAs were able to get Michael Littman on a special office hours, which was awesome. Last semester they got Richard Sutton. Littman is a genius, and it was an awesome experience. \n\nOne note, after reading some negative reviews, Michael Littman is a professor at Brown. He doesn't have access to GA Tech systems (Piazza). Fine to down vote the course for Isbell not showing up, but it's ignorant to down vote for a Browns prof not being active at GA Tech. \n\nTAs are knowledgeable. They will answer your questions. They sometimes need to review specifics (if referencing a paper). You will not find a better group of TAs.",

I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

The course requires a fast and consistent pace to keep up with the homework assignments and projects; I would not advise having any vacation or work responsibilities that take you away from the course for more than 2-3 days at a time. It definitely seems like this course has gotten quite a bit harder over time, as the workload indicated by the early reviews were quite lower than what I experienced. I would put this one and ML (7641) at roughly the same required time commitment, though RL is more focused on implementation and achieving a certain result, while ML is more focused on analysis and writing. \n\nPros:\n--Interesting material that really covers the seminal developments of the field\n--TAs do a strong job managing the class\n--The fastest grading I've experienced in the OMSCS program (tied with ML)\n--The autograder for the homework assignments was helpful. (You'll want to max out the points on homework to offset the inevitable point losses on the projects and final exam. )\n--The projects are interesting and challenging, with the second one being the best. \n\nCons:\n--No interaction at all with the professor\n--The style of the lectures isn't concise and sometimes sacrifices the content for entertainment. Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers",

It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",

Assignments not hard just confusing. \n\nPrep: Have good familiarity with different variants of linux, and be familiar enough to have to deal with VMs without UIs. Having a basic understanding of python, network\\programming basics, and android development. \n\nMy expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen. After the course I would say some of these expectations were met. \n\nThe course feels like a great overview of some of the security vulnerabilities in the existing structure of networks and the internet. It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all. \n\nThe TAs lead this class completely, with one TA standing way above all the rest. And he wasn’t even the head TA.",

The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all. This course also has little learning for industry experienced developers, but it worked as a decent transition back into academia after being out of it for a while.",

I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them. I would break my workload estimate down to ~6 hours of project work and 2 hours of viewing lectures and reading papers.",

In the demo that you are required to give at the end of the phase there is no proper rubric as to what and how you are required to demonstrate. No complete guidelines. They give you something called a demo guidelines for phase 3. Even if you have it all working according to those guidelines you will have points deducted because some column is not sorted by date by default. I think the project should only test you on what is taught in the class. Not on how well you create a UI that interacts with your database. That is completely outside the scope of what is taught.

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters.",

I took this class thinking it would be an easy summer class. For me personally, it required a lot more work than I anticipated especially on the project side (programming side). Might be just me, but I felt like the test were trickier, basically not doing as well on the test as I thought I did when I took the test. Make sure you know C or have done some C programming before you take this class, there are MANY people who drop out during the first project just for this reason of thinking they will learn on the fly and are not able to keep up. From the perspective of someone with a undergrad CS degree (obviously this will vary based on your undergrad CS program rigor) everything up to about a little after mid term I already had familiarity with or forgot (Obviously the class went in greater depth of the topics I already covered in undergrad so I learn't new stuff here and there in the first half of the content). On the second part of the semester is where It covers virtualization and distributed systems, RPC and was where I really saw new content for me personally. If I took this during the longer semester I probably would have rated this class a medium difficultly based on my background. \n\nLike I said prior, unless you are pretty good in C, the projects will consume A LOT of your time and the test seemed tricky or maybe for the summer I was just a bad test taker.. Luckily I got the grade I needed and probably deserved. I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to build their OS fundamental and/or C or system programming knowledge.",

The tests were well-designed (grammatical errors aside), and despite no previous training in SQL, etc., none of the Database System Concepts & Design-relevant content was challenging. Even for functional dependencies, the course stops short of covering anything but the basics. \n\nNow for the bad: The administration for this course was a clown-car of dropped balls, misinformation, delays, and unprofessionalism, easily leap-frogging \"slapstick\" into \"piteous. \" No announcement or instructor response was free from substantive errors. No projected deadline for, say, feedback, was even close to adhered to. The rubric for the final project summed to 90%. \n\nA few weeks into the course, after an exam, someone asked on Piazza (an asynchronous medium) \"Would grades be curved? What is the % breakdown for scores for A, B, etc. ? Thanks\". The head TA, Terry \"Will J\" Johnson replied, \"Seriously? I'm fighting to get the grades uploaded, and they've been out for about 5 minutes, and you can't wait for me to finish before you start asking questions?\" That sort of emotional outburst and unprofessional behavior was common. People quickly stopped using Piazza for most questions, to avoid exposing themselves to that sort of thing. \n\nThis course was poorly-planned, poorly run, poorly organized, and had a significant focus on irrelevant material (thank goodness someone on our team knew PHP, that old mainstay of database design). I'm going to take my credits and my grade, reorient my schedule to steer clear of \"Will J, Head TA\", and traipse the hell away from this dumpster fire. I suggest you do likewise.",

The exams were straightforward. The projects were of high quality and enforced students' learning: a basic market simulator, a random-tree learner (and how to beat this type of learners), Q-Learning robot maze navigation, and a learning trading agent. That last project (a learning trading agent) brought together virtually everything we learnt in that class into a single project! It was super fun, but was hard and time consuming. \n\nIn terms of time commitments, there were many quiet periods where nothing was due. But, I spent most of that time time reading suggested materials as much as I could. For instance, I read Prof. Balch book from cover to cover, skimmed Tom Mitchell's \"Machine Learning\" book, etc. And so, you may end up with less than 15 hrs/week on this class. \n\nOverall, I came out with a well-rounded understanding of what's going on in both ML and trading. Kudos to Prof. Balch for this solid class and his amazing organization. He was very funny and had a dry sense of humor. I would imagine taking his class in person might have been a very fun experience. Also, according to my fiancee, he had cute chuckles, which made her laugh.",

We also got two office hours with Dr. Thrun, which was awesome - he answered every single question, both times. \n\nBeyond this, the class is rather messy. It feels like they tried to take a short, free Udacity course and turn in into a full semester's worth of work by extending it with two projects that go beyond the scope of the lectures. Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics). \n\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course. \n\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own. It is very cool to learn from Dr. Thrun.",

As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon.

Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend).",

I'm aware that my background definitely helped a lot, so I hope this review could be helpful for people with a background similar to mine. \n\nThe main skills needed for this class are:\n- Experience on Linux CLI, environment variables, how to install packages/libraries, etc. Also knowing how to use a Virtual Machine. \n- Some background in Machine Learning: what cross-validation is, typical metrics, how to train a model, and how to run predictions on it for supervised and unsupervised methods. \n- Experience working with data in both databases and structured files: SQL, aggregation functions, joins, constraints, etc. \n- Having the maturity/confidence to quickly learn on your own how to hack your way in some new programming language. \n\nI have 15 years industry experience with databases (not big data), scripting languages in Linux, and I had previously taken ML, ML4T, RL. The assignments took me like 20-30 hours each (spread through 2 weeks, a workload of 15 hours/week). \n\nOn the other hand I can see how for someone with no experience AT ALL in the skills mentioned above, this class could take as much as 30-40 hours/week. \n\nSome people have mentioned \"you HAVE to LEARN Pig/Hbase/Hive\". I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient. Sadly I ran out of space for this review",

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting.",

Those first few weeks are very important as they will change the complexion of your experience in the course depending on what you choose. I worked on a team, and I think that is the best way to approach this class. You have other students that are holding you accountable and that are dependent upon you to get a good grade. You can do the project individually if you'd like (most people did, but I wanted a bigger project). It is also worth noting that you have one TA in this course - your mentor. So if you have any questions or want to know what to do to succeed, you have one person you can ask. In my opinion, this made it much easier because you're not getting conflicting information or trying to juggle multiple people's expectations. It is also much easier to get answers to your questions because one TA isn't trying to answer all of the questions - just their group of students' questions.",

While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course). \n\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects.

Very little participation by Prof Isbell, but the TAs were incredibly enthusiastic, involved, and had considerable knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe videos are well done. They're a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn't your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense. \n\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there's a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don't think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn't explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you're taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project. \n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don't really have pedagogical value. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something.",

I will admit that I learned a good bit in this course about a wide variety of different topics. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to teach most of this to myself. This, in my mind, made the course very stressful because the skills needed to complete the projects were not taught in the course. There was a lot of \"here's the manual, here's a paper, learn this new technology, complete the project. \" Some of the project write-ups were downright terrible and did not include nearly enough information for someone inexperienced with that particular system to complete it on their own, certainly not within the given time frame. Thank goodness for Piazza. Wouldn't have been able to finish the class without it. \n\nAnother thing which really bugged me: each project had a separate VM, and NONE of them were ready to go out of the box. Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work. \n\nFinal thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza. Start projects as soon as they become available and set aside plenty of time to work on them each day.",

Failed to impart any real understanding beyond the pre-packaged video content due to fear of releasing any real help (or content for future sessions) by openly discussing the problem both before or after the fact. Missed learning opportunity. \n\nAgain, the TA being overtly secretive about revealing approaches (not their fault) to the solutions produced the wrong kind of struggle for students. (Vastly different from ML4T, CP or CV--where you're guided to spend time focused on the right problems. ) And prevented forming a deep understanding of the mechanics of the concepts presented. Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems—hence you’re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken. \n\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn’t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code.

The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar.

The professor has only made 3 very minor appearances on Piazza, only one TA is active, and the lectures are short and have almost nothing to do with the course content. Everything that I've learned has been through self-learning, which 1) is not a very efficient way to learn a large amount of new material as I find myself constantly reinventing the wheel and 2) I can do this for free on my own time, focusing on exactly what I'm interested in. The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped. If you actually work in this area or want to work in this area, the course might be worth it since it forces you to use a lot of different technologies, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou'll learn a lot in this class like the other reviews state, but it's because you'll spend almost as much time on it as you do at your full time job, not because it's actually a good class. On the bright side it's probably an easy A if you have 600 hours to devote to it over the semester.",

            "text": "I would recommend this course if you have no prior software engineering background, though I would skip it if you have had an undergrad SE class or SE work experience. There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren't designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn't a complaint, that's the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this. If something isn't compatible with the auto-grader, or there was a simple typo in a commit hash, function name, etc., then expect to receive zero points for that portion of the assignment, with no real wiggle room!",

I had to spend the summer after the class to self-learn these skills from online resources to get prepared for interview questions. In fact, we talked about this at the end of the semester through Pizza and I'm very glad that the instructors and TAs are open to hear our thoughts.

Unfortunately, its a poor reflection of the OMSCS program and hopefully the feedback on OMSCentral will be used to improve the course.\n\nThere is almost no interaction between the instructors/TA and students on Piazza -- it was the least amount of Piazza/Slack activity I've observed so far in this program. There's pretty much nothing due for the first 4 weeks, then there's an extremely simple project that is made difficult through lack of clarity. After that, there's nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student's broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation. The books are just a really general overview of the topic. This course takes only a few hours of work per week to complete in its current state, and when the appropriate amount of effort is put forth, it will give you a 50% chance at a B, and 50% chance at an A. \n\nThe instructor is likable and he does a good job with the lectures, so that is one benefit. The instructor is knowledgeable in his field, just as you'd expect from a GA Tech professor.\n\nThis review isnt in retaliation for a bad grade, or a personal attack on any of the instructors; I received an A, and the instructors were willing to help a student when contacted. My theory is that outside of the lectures, the course was developed and operated by TAs from the brick and mortar program who just don't have much stake in the online program.

This may be one of the better \"easy\" electives to take in the OMSCS program, but it's definitely not one of the best courses in the program. \n\nThe lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course.",

This is a very hard class. If you are like me and 1) were not good in math theory and 2) have not done this sort of thing since college, then this will probably be really hard. I would recommend doing all the homework problems, and all the problems related to the material in the text book. When you are done with those, find another text book and do all the problems there. Practice is the only way you are going to pass, unless you are just really good at this sort of thing.\n\nThere is a project but it isn't worth too much, though it took me a long time to complete. The homework problems are more or less meaningless for your grade, but very important if you want to learn the material. The exams are all closed book. You get partial credit, but that means you made smaller mistake, and you still lose a very large portion, so you really need to know the material. To be fair to Dr. Vigoda, he tells you what he expects you to know to pass, and he holds you to that. Grading is very quick on exams for the amount of students and the content in them. Office hours are very good too, and I had to watch almost all of them to get at least some grasp of the materials.\n\nI would recommend taking this class early, but not before you get some study habits down. It took me 15 PTO days, and studying almost every night to get down most of this material. If I took this when I first started OMSCS (I have 24 credits as it stands) then I would have not been able to adjust to the workload and the amount of effort needed to pass. Also, it is probably going to suck. Many students did not do well on one or more exams (myself included), and though you will see the stereotypical \"look at how smart I am!\" tech students in piazza, remember that others are struggling as much as you are. Don't drop too early, so that you at least get some of the material down, and plow through it. ",

            "text": "This course is very challenging. By far the most challenging class of the program for me (and this is my 9th course)\n\nThe content presentation is excellent. The homework, tests and project are all well constructed, fairly graded, and directly inline with the content covered in the course materials. However, it is not a simple regurgitation of the materials. It is an application of the materials and so you really have to understand and practice the use of the materials (the algorithms mostly) in solving problems because you will have to be able to apply them to other situations on the tests. \n\nThe grading is heavily weighted towards tests with 85% of the grade coming from tests (10% from project and 5% from homework). \n\nHomework, while it has little impact on the grade is a must-do. In fact, to succeed in the class I would say that you have to go out and find other homework from other courses and do those problems as well. \n\nThe project was a coding assignment which was interesting but not too challenging once you wrapped your head around it. They have indicated that they may add an additional coding project in a future iteration of the course, but don't plan on reducing the grading focus on exams. \n\nThis class has probably had the greatest participation in Piazza of both the instructor and the TA staff of any of the courses I have been in and that has been very helpful in understanding some of the nuances around the algorithms and their application. \n\nOverall a great class.",

            "text": "***This review is for Fall 2017***\n\nI really do not like this class. I regret taking it. Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.",

Six of that was initially setting up the development environment (mostly because I had a new and unfamiliar hardware setup), 70 on the projects, 23 on Piazza, Slack, etc., and 26 hours watching video lectures. (I log my hours with Toggl. ) It turns out that I have a pretty good background for the coursework we've done so far (concurrency and IPC mechanisms). The next 5 weeks may prove to be a bit harder for me. \n\nThe TAs have been *very* engaged, and there's a lot of healthy discussion on Piazza and the OMSCS6200. slack. com channel, which has been fun. (That explains why I've spent 23 hours on it. ) The prof (Dr. Ada Gavrilovska Habl) has been very fair, and is an excellent lecturer. This is my first semester, so I don't have a basis for comparison, but I'm very pleased with this course, and I recommend it. \n\nProjects are individual and have been well-designed. Development is in C, which is entirely appropriate for an OS course. If you only know a scripting language such as JavaScript, R, or Python, you might want to hit the first project hard, right away, to climb that learning curve.",

It was tough material for me to grasp, and I needed a better game plan than what I've done for other classes.\nAfter retaking it this spring, I wound up with an A. Here's how:\nSo this spring when I took the class, I went in knowing that I needed to work on this class every day. So for the first month or so, I did at least 1 dynamic programming problem a day. And not just the ones they recommend - I did all of the ones in the DPV text, all of the ones in the Kleinberg-Tardos text. I also watched Erik Demaine's lectures on dynamic programming. This is all in addition to the every day requirements of this class (the homework and lectures, etc). For dynamic programming - draw the damn table on your scratch paper. Every time...draw the table! When we got around to the NP Complete problems I did the same thing - at least one problem a day. The other topics were tough as well, but these 2 topics are the most crucial to passing this course.\nAnything he says in the lecture is a 'key idea' or 'key concept' is going to show up on a test. Even if you think, how could they possibly test that? Trust me, it'll be on the exam.\nAlso, watch the office hours.\nThere's a project (they choose a different project each semester), but it is not difficult and only worth 10% of the grade. The tests are the bulk of the grade (85%).",

The textbook used was \"Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd edition\". The course covers almost the entire textbook. This is a great course that gives an overview of all AI/ML techniques. Even though it covers such a wide breadth of topics, the course does fair amount of justice to them. All the topics are covered in a depth that you can get a fairly good idea about the topics. The knowledge you will gain in this course will not be shallow as is usually feared from courses that have a very wide course. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, I found the course to be fairly difficult. That is also given the fact that I did not have prior AI/ML experience. The assignments make us code various AI/ML algos from scratch with helps in a deeper understanding. Assignments will take time if your situation is like I had. Assignments are in python and good understanding of numpy can help. \n\nExams are open book and pretty tough but fun nonetheless. \n\nTA interactions are great. In my time we had at least 2 great TAs who were always active on slack. You might find lectures a bit too shallow but textbook and additional readings make up for that. \n\nIMO this course is a must if you dont have a prior AI/ML experience and want to pursue ML specialization.",

I'm not sure whether I would recommend it as a first course for other students or not (if you have some sec. background it might not be too bad). Most of the project writeups have been quite confusing, and in many cases (for 3 out of 4 projects so far) the TAs have had to make major updates to the projects and/or requirements the while the students were working on them. We have also had some serious issues with autograders this semester that have caused a lot of headaches for students and staff. Fortunately, when issues arise the TAs have been pretty flexible and understanding for the most part. Some TAs have been much more responsive and helpful than others (shout-out to William Lucas for always being helpful on Slack and Piazza!), but overall I get the impression that there isn't a lot of communication amongst all the TAs.

My favorite parts were learning about the original design principles of the internet (since it was a department of defense project), and how TCP flows and congestion control work. I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended. If you're a solid programmer, this is a good first course to take.",

Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester).

The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I'm not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you'll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project).

These are the worst TA's I have ever had. At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday!",

This part of the lectures seemed to gloss over how they're actually built, which was problematic, since one of the projects was centered around them. \n\nSpeaking of projects, they were useful, and it was cool to implement some of the algorithms/processes used in the various compiler phases. Grading seemed to be very generous; I got full marks on both projects. I'm not sure how they were graded or how many different types of inputs were thrown at them. There was a partner option for the projects, which I reluctantly took advantage of for the second project. Just a heads up in case you're anti-group project like me. \n\nThe exam was tough but fair.

I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3. ",

Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\n\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.

There's a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\n\n\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don't have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn't be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don't miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\n\n\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn't very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you  still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn't check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I've taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.   \n\n\nIn general I can't recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches.

After the first month or so it the content did branch away from Info Sec. This class is structured very similarly to Info Sec. Mainly project based. Final exam. Quizzes. I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.\n\nOverall, a good class if you are new to security. Probably easier if you take Info Sec first. ",

I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\n\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\n\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\n\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\n\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time. You have to make sacrifices to accommodate the class's flimsical finalization of assignments, with short deadlines.\n\nIf I were to go back in time, I'd still take the class again.",

I had a strong non-Python programming background as well as an intro Python class and I  found the class pretty easy. However, people with less experience found it had a very steep learning curve and could be very difficult.\n\nAssignments are released weekly but you have two weeks to do them. The first programming exam was timed (2 hours), but after feedback from students they decided to change it to a 24 hour exam that must be completed within a 7-day window. I found the exam still only took me 2-3 hours to complete. The final was also 24 hours in 7 days, so they will likely keep that format going forward. \n\nAssignments and exams are in Jupyter notebooks that walk you though the exercises. Lectures correspond to most of the notebooks, but if you're a quick learner you can get almost all the material just from the notebook. Instead of writing the entire large program, the notebook includes some code written by the instructors and you write code to fill in the blanks.\n\nOverall, I found it pretty easy, and it paired well with ISYE 6501 (Intro Analytics). The instructors had some trouble with getting assignments up on time, class organization, and responding to Piazza in a timely manner, but I think most of that had to do with the fact it was the first semester the course was offered online.\n\nMy one course content complaint would be that the end of the course, which seemed like the whole point/the culmination of the course, was extremely rushed at the end (3 shorter assignments due within 2 days of each other). I wish less time had been spent on the Python basics at the beginning and more time was spent on that actual analytical modeling methods.",

If you have any experience programming, you'll immediately notice corollaries to whatever language you are familiar with.  The TA Office Hours are very useful for learning how to use R if you're struggling.  The homework assignments help you understand how to use the concepts from the lectures in an applied way.  The course project is essentially a slightly longer homework assignment, on a topic of your own choosing.  It follows a basic case study format.  The exams are multiple choice and drag & drop.

            "text": "Not a good class.\n\nMaterial: The first half of the class teaches you some outdated APIs with little to no documentations, which feel like some orphaned research project. I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%.\nAssignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don't expect any leniency. There's no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture.\nLectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what's going on, which you really don't since....\nExams: Completely different from the samples and the lectures. I mean, seriously, if I didn't study Statistics in college (yes, statistics) I would have easily lost 25% on the exams. Esoteric concepts from lectures were drilled, so you have to really think outside of the box. It's excellent to get students to drop the class and apparently so, since piazza traffics pretty went quiet the weeks after the midterm.\nTAs and Professor: The Professor did not show up at all so we can safely disregard him. TAs work really hard answering questions and maintaining conversation but harder not revealing solutions. I feel sorry for them, since their hands are tied. The way assignments are simply prevent them from having a meaningful conversation about the concepts. Sometimes by explaining things in a non-revealing way they ended up confusing people. \n\nSave your time and $800+ and take another class. ",

The reason being that the content, assignments and projects introduces a lot of different fields - network sockets, controls (primarily open vs closed loop with single and multi-variable feedback), system modeling, embedded programming and architecture design & analysis among other CPS topics. The course can be coupled with SDP course and I think the two together shall provide a strong fundamental mechanisms required for other OMSCS courses. \n\nI found the Udacity lectures to be very good but with lot of information. It is a good thing! I took lot of hand-written notes as I went through the lectures and that was helpful to enforce the concepts/theory/case studies. The assignments were primarily hands-on, i.e. programming in C or Python. Starter codes were provided for all assignments/projects and the tasks themselves don't require a lot of programming but it requires understanding of how the starter code works. Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability. Beyond that any additional information required for the tasks has to be researched just like in any graduate course.\n\nThe course towards the end introduces AADL (a model based language) for a project but the time frame to learn AADL was short and coupled with the project deliverable which made the project more challenging. But challenges are fun, right? I found this to be one of the best part of the course. It would have been nice if at least the last two projects were based on AADL as that would give ample time to learn the language and related simulation tool and also be able to focus on the required project tasks properly.\n\nIf you are interested to know about - systems at large, embedded systems, real-time systems and controls, robotics, quadcopters (lot of examples based on this) and architecture development, then take this course. It is a good introduction from both computer science and CPS perspective.",

The Udacity lectures were informative with easy-to-grasp concepts, and Professor Orso has inspiring enthusiasm for the subject matter. This being my first course I can't compare to other GT classes, but this is easily the best online course I have ever taken. I appreciated the weekly YouTube office hours and was not required to post a mindless forum thread on a weekly basis, in contrast to my undergrad experience. The weekly workload is entirely doable if you read the instructions CAREFULLY and IGNORE your classmates' forum posts until you've absolutely hit a wall and need an answer to something in particular. Using this strategy, even while working 50 hour weeks I devoted about 4 days out of the week to schoolwork (this 1 class) and managed to get no less than a 94% on each assignment, I consider myself a software developer newbie with average intelligence. My favorite part of the course was the group project which we split up equally on documentation and coding, and I could not have asked for a better team. Having said all that, the TAs do take their sweet time on grading assignments, apparently especially if you choose to contest a grade (I did not), and I rarely saw any interaction by other TAs on the forum besides the two heads (perhaps they were grading?). There are some concepts that I would have liked to go deeper on, such as Agile, and the lectures could be updated with lessons on the currently used software. These did not manage to spoil my enjoyment of the course.",

Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety.",

There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot.

I'd still take this class, but I would prepare yourself for this sloppiness.  I would also skip on buying the required textbooks: not useful for the course itself, IMO.",

That’s nice.  But everything about the class felt like a joke to me.  The content of the class is super hand-wavy and not really tied to anything useful (as far as I can tell).  The projects were a little fun at first, but they only use the course content in a superficial way.  For me, the writing was a terrible use of time and energy.  The only thing I learned while writing for this class is how to write against the given rubric.

            "text": "Background knowledge:  Do not be fooled by the supposed required background knowledge.  They said we needed to be \"familiar\" with \"a high level programming language like Java or C++).  For your own health and safety, do not attempt this class without a very solid foundation in BOTH Java and C++, and experience in C and Bash scripting would definitely help to have in advance.  I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment.  Don't make my mistakes.\n\nClass material:  There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class.  Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it's the latter.  There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving.  Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\n\nAssignments:  This is what killed the class for me.  Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this).  There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment.  For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones.  Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn't be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn't understand, which was frustrating.  Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\n\nExams:  The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair.  We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like.  The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards.  The exams are open-lecture notes.  \n\nProfessors/TAs:  One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions.  The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs.  The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\n\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.  I am hoping I will have a better experience in other classes.  Overall, I can't necessarily recommend the class but if you are better prepared (see section 1 of my review) you will probably suffer much less than I did.",

There were 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. The lectures felt very fast-paced and covered a broad subject at a shallow level, so it was hard to actually learn much from them. I agree with another student that the projects were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. Some of the projects even felt like they really belonged in Info Sec - as if the professor didn't accomplish everything he wanted to in that class, so he's using Network Security as a place to put the overflow. The professor's involvement in the class was minimal - I was active a few times in Slack, and often on Piazza, but I never saw any activity from Prof. Lee in either place, which is disappointing. The class was instead run (somewhat haphazardly) by TAs. The quizzes were poorly or ambiguously worded, sometimes such that there was more than one technically correct answer. Project writeups were often filled with errors or inconsistencies, which had to be resolved on Piazza, and unfortunately made the projects a bit harder to tackle since it was hard to distinguish parts you didn't understand from parts that were just wrong. Project skeleton code had typos that made one wonder if the TAs had actually tried to run the code before publishing it. The autograders were also poorly written, and many students (myself included) had to request regrades for one or more projects due to autograder issues.  Overall, could be a good class with interesting material, but feels poorly executed.",

            "text": "The content of this course is really interesting, though it feels to me like too much for one course - 30 hours of dense lecture videos exceed any class I've taken so far. The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It's my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I'd imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn't enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\n\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I've taken thus far. For example, there are a combined 320 unanswered questions or unresolved followups on Piazza, roughly 10x the next worst class I've taken by this metric. The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I've rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston's office hours, which were excellent. The actual instructor, Dr. Essa, was completely absent - no office hours, no Piazza, etc. In fact, one of just two times he ever showed up on Piazza was to attack some students who implied that he was absent!\n\n\n\n\n",

Let's start from the top: a class called \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\" should, at some point, mention \"Analytics\" somewhere. They didn't even try to connect it with the subject that 100% of its students came to study.\n\nInstead, this is a hodge-podge of (way, way too many) business concepts crammed together, taught with no connection to one another in four batches by four professors. The first lecturer, teaching business accounting, was absolutely atrocious. He clearly was just winging his way through his lectures, rambling with maybe a loose outline in front of him. Editing the transcripts into some semblance of a coherent study tool, it was possible to edit out 40-70% of the text without any loss of information, so redundant and bloated was the text. The second lecturer was marginally better, but his handwriting in the few problems we were given as examples was atrocious, and he would throw out acronyms without explanation.\n\nThere were far too few checks for understanding and practice problems, and then the homework and exams were brutally unforgiving. Accounting problems that would take 10-20 minutes to complete would have single, graded all-or-nothing multiple-choice submissions (and sometimes, fill-in-the-blank, better-get-it-exactly-right-the-first-time fields). All of the other choices were gotchas based on common errors you may have made because the inadequate teaching you received hadn't prepared you to do it exactly right. \n\nAnd then abruptly midway through the course, the graded homework stopped, replaced by a torrent of lectures -- nearly 100 more videos crammed full of micro-topics with no indication as to what was important, what would be tested on, what was intended to ground larger important concepts. The practice problems were absolutely all over the place, making it totally unclear as to what we could expect on the final. \n\nStaff didn't seem to care about student's concerns when these were voiced. Flury's most common response to students worried about their grade was that the grades overall were adequate. When students said concepts weren't clear, the typical response was essentially that, yes, they were. Oh, sorry, our bad, I guess.\n\nThis was my fourth online class through Georgia Tech and by far the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed the other three, and look forward to the rest of the program. Had MGT 6754 been the first I took, I would not have returned. The contrast is about what I would expect from a school with a top-ten-rated analytics program and a business school described by the Financial Times as \"third-tier.\" ",

The videos are mostly good, but I highly recommend people to watch David Silver series.  It seriously helps for the first 4 HW's and 2 projects.  I would actually watch him first, then Charles and Michael.  They are very deep and abstract, while he is really concrete and practical.

Watching at 1.3x speed is a good idea to get broad strokes, especially if you don't love proofs.\n\nThe final is pretty hard -  make sure to study for it.\n\nFinally, I did well on the projects, but I somehow unlocked what the T.A's did not spell out. Which is that you need to write your report about what the project means, not what you did. Which may not be obvious, because doing the actual work involved a lot of head-banging and late nights, so by the time you are done with the work you may forget to think about why you did it at all.\n\n\n",

You'll be doing a ton of writing. We had three 1500-word project reflections, three 1000-word assignments, a take-home 2000-word midterm, a take-home 3000-word final, and three Peer Feedbacks to complete for each of those. Coding is limited to your 3 projects, which for most will be focused on writing a program that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (Java or Python with Pillow/NumPy). A small group of students was allowed to pursue Alternative Projects 2 and 3 which focused on writing a FAQ-based chatbot (Python/NLTK). The lectures were well-made, but cover very high level topics. There really isn't anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway. The course is very generously curved with anything over the class mean being an A, so it's an easy course overall. The instructor/TA interaction on Piazza is great and I was glad to see Dr Goel engaging with students at least a few times each week, even while traveling. We had a nice community going on Slack, too, which helped build camaraderie and made it fun to participate. Peer Feedbacks were very hit and miss and probably should have been scrapped entirely for the Final Exam. Peer grading didn't affect anything, but led to morale drops when getting overly-negative feedback and a lot of confusion when asked to grade another student without knowing the correct answer. Overall, it's a fine class. It's front-loaded, smoothly-run, and generally fun, but you're not likely to come out of it with many new skills that can be directly applied to anything. As with most courses, though, it's what you make of it.",

I found Prof.  Summet to be very helpful and responsive on Piazza.  As others have said, the projects can take a long time.  The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.  Most of the assignments and early projects culminate in the later ones so if you fall behind or have a bad project early plan to spend extra time on the later assignments.",

The exams determine most of your grade but it is very important to do the homework in order to understand the material.  Dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP Completeness consumed most of the class with a few other things such as FTT and RSA thrown in lightly.  Memorization does very little good on the tests as they are all about the application of the concepts (i.e. use the algorithms from class to show how to solve this seemingly unrelated problem that you've never seen before).  Understanding Big O notation is required.  The book is also required for homework purposes and reading it is also important.  Surprisingly well run for a first run course and surprisingly fast grading for a written exam based course.  Test solutions are hand written and scanned while using Proctortrack.",

I came into this class with programming knowledge (python) and some linear algebra but almost zero R experience and no analytics experience.   This class was more time consuming for me because I've had very little exposure to analytical modelling.  If you come into this class with experience how much time you need each week will go down considerably.  Early on in the course getting up to speed on R was a challenge but once I was comfortable in R the amount of time required for the homework goes down quite a bit.  There is homework almost every week.  It's well designed and if you actually try to learn you'll learn quite a bit.  I encourage people to use the TA office hours as confirmation of approach after you have tried to solve the homework on your own.  You'll learn far less if you just watch the TA office hours and copy their code.  Exams are hard but fair.  Dr Sokol does a good job of making you think.  The videos for this class are very well done and to me shows Dr Sokol's strong understanding of the MOOC format.  The videos are short and densely packed with information making them quick and easy to review while at the same time, packed with information. ",

I needed it to finish up the ML specialization and found it to be a very different class from the others I have taken. There is very little actual programming (1 programming assignment this semester that was relatively easy and able to be completed with little code once the concept and problem is understood). The class focusses on theory and math and consists of HW assignments that are worth so little that they are practically optional and 4 tests. This model made it very easy to fall behind if you weren't diligently studying and doing practice problems to prepare for the tests. Professor Vigoda is awesome. The videos are high quality and straight to the point. I liked that he explained concepts in what I found an easy to understand manner. He clearly tried to use simple language and provide multiple examples to drive points home. This class is a lot of work. I took this class along with DB Systems and I stuck it out but overall would recommend taking this class alone. Very rewarding and the staff was super responsive especially the professor. Class was run spectacularly especially considering it was the first semester. I learned so much the past few months that help to put other computer science topics in perspective.",

In my opinion, The videos are definitely the best in the OMSCS. The material is dense but Dr Bobick cuts through the math and makes it digestible. He has a great sense of humor, and even his interaction with Megan (the videographer) cracked me up several times. Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well. The final project will easily take up the time of 3 assignments put together. Matthew Houston definitely deserves high praise for his high-quality recorded office hours. To conclude, It's a lot of work, but you'll be glad you did it.\n\nAs an aside, I was looking at the table of contents of the CV books on Amazon, and was amazed that the class covered MORE THAN ENTIRE BOOKS on the subject!",

            "text": "Incredible class. The material is extremely interesting, and the assignments/project weren't overly difficult and really emphasized lecture material (although they were VERY time consuming). This was my first class in the program, but this course is probably one of the best courses I've ever taken! Including all of my graduate-level classes as well! Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\n\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick's videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They're also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you'll learn quite a bit within each topic. Assignments matched the lecture material fairly well, and were for the most part well-defined and weren't too confusing.\n\nAssignment breakdown with estimated difficulty / time consumption for those that like this sort of thing:\nAssignment 1 -- easy; ~4-8 hours\nAssignment 2 -- hard; 40-60 hours\nAssignment 3 -- mid; ~25-40 hours\nAssignment 4 -- mid; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 5 -- mid/hard; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 6 -- mid; ~20-30 hours\n\nWe had 2 weeks to complete each assignment, and they were always back-to-back so there was really no break in between. Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn't work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\n\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class. \n\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston's office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\n\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. It would help to review some linear algebra, and numpy if you aren't comfortable with using it yet. If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you'll be using this package a lot in the class. Don't wait until the last minute to start assignments, start on them early so it doesn't bite you when the deadlines approach!",

Your homework assignments occur within a Jupyter Notebook that has test cells that determine whether or not you completed the exercise correctly. Having an issue with something? Then just copy the test cell data into a new cell and use that to debug you code. The set-up of the homework made it feel like they wanted you to succeed and were giving you the framework to do so. I wouldn't take it without some background in code, though - you need to have a foundation that this class builds on.\n\nThe part that challenged me the most was the last few weeks when we dove into the deep end with linear algebra. For someone who does pretty well with math but has never taken a linear algebra course (and thought it was a good idea to skip it...which wasn't in fact a good idea), I got to the point where I was able to complete the assignments, but I'm still a little hazy as to the WHY behind what I was coding. So, I'll be taking the Udacity Linear Algebra refresher suggested by another reviewer.\n\nThe midterms/final were discussed by other reviewers for I won't hash them out. I'll just say that once they got the format figured out (24 hours to complete, open everything), they weren't too bad. It's a challenge for sure, but they were doable.",

As other reviewers said, it's a great intro to just about every Analytics concept that you're cover to see as part of the OMSA program. And, for me at least, it helped me figure out which electives I wanted to take.\n\nNow, with that said, it's a challenging class especially if you've never used R before. I find it to be a pretty finicky programming language, and there were nights where I struggled for an hour or two to figure out what I was doing. By the time I was done, I felt like I had learned a good bit, though, so maybe it was worth it.\n\nHomeworks aren't bad, though a bit time consuming. Midterms/final were a little bit tricky - you really have to sit and think through a question and pick the answer that seems the most right. You get a handwritten cheat sheet for each midterm and 2 of them for the final - and these saved me. But you need to put a lot on them since briefly covered concepts could be on the exams.\n\nProject for the class was simple enough and followed the format of other case studies.\n\nIt's not easy, but you learn a whole lot, and it's a great introduction to what to expect for the rest of the OMSA program.",

There is no curve, and the mid-term and final exams are like sprints, you barely have time to complete them, and a lot of students actually weren't able to complete the mid-term. The extra credit assignment is a joke, it requires more effort to complete than multiple projects combined, and it only contributes to 2% of your total grade. These horrible features of this course make it extremely nerve-racking, because you can easily lose a letter grade in the blink of an eye. It almost seems at times as if the professor dislikes seeing students do good in this course, and he tries really hard to prevent you from earning an A; I was able to earn one in the end, but it wasn't an \"easy A\" at all. I personally avoided asking questions via Reddit, because of the snarky replies the professor would issue to students. The course serves as a good introduction to Machine Learning, and you get to apply Machine Learning to stock trading in the last project, which was awesome.  Something else which you need to consider is the fact that projects build on each other, therefore if you fail to complete a project, or you implement it incorrectly, you will be toast.",

            "text": "As a graduate of OMSCS and someone who is a good ways through the new OMSA program, I can say this is, by a wide margin, the worst course I have taken as a graduate student on all metrics. The lectures are twenty minute sleeping pills where a menagerie of different professors read slides verbatim and provide long, rambling, and excessive examples to the point of further confusion. The course content is all over the place and seems hastily assembled, as if someone just concatenated four standard-length courses into a Frankenstein's monster of business school intro courses. Grades are few and far between (the two exams count for 70% of the grade), and the professor (the one of four presumably in charge) seems to have little if any grasp on online quiz structure, having involved, high point value multi-step questions for which there is no partial credit (e.g. \"Select the correct eight of these fifteen possible answers\"), and incorrect responses that seem to want to actively trick students into wrong answers instead of guiding the learning process. On Piazza, when the professor chooses to make an appearance, he is usually combative and seems to often resent the sheer audacity of those who may want to actually learn this material. The course would be a poor refresher for those pursuing an MBA, and seems especially inappropriate for those pursuing a degree in computational analytics. Towards the end it became clear that at no point would any of the material actually tie into analytics, making it even further baffling that this course is foundational for the analytics program at Georgia Tech.\n\nFor those considering taking this course, I can simply suggest you put it off as long as possible, in hopes the course will be reworked or removed altogether.\n\nFor those responsible for building and administering OMS programs, I can only say this course is an embarrassment and actively damages the reputation of the OMS community.",

            "text": "So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\n\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\n\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\n\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.",

Very well organized, and a fair grading scheme. No grading on a curve so everyone cooperates on Piazza (within the 'no sharing code' constraint).  I could feel myself learning as the course progressed. Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks. Here's my time breakdown by week measured by Toggl, so you can schedule your accordingly: 18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 31, 32, 21, 16, 15, 24, 24, 23, 14, 50, 31, 16. That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it's the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don't fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don't procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you're a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston's recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it's likely to bring your grade down.\nSome criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them). The biggest criticism is that because of the final project, there are no assignments on the later sections and I didn't feel like I really learnt them.",

They're given the task of teaching the course\nGrading:  The 90% Above and Beyond is the stupidest grading rubric I've ever come across.\nProjects:  While interesting, I don't believe they'll ever benefit me.\nTest:  The test is open book and there are two attempts; this sounds great...but like another reviewer put it, \"turns into a digital scavenger hunt.\"  I also found it to be marred by difficult/tricky wording (most likely by someone whose first language is not english) with a majority of the questions being of the delightful format, \"Select all that apply/are correct\".  I did not feel that the final exam tested my knowledge of anything that you might take away from the course.  Also covers quite a few papers that aren't really discussed during lectures.\nTime commitment: If I'm combining the time spent working on assignments with the time to watch lectures, then it's about 20 hours, if not counting the lectures it's a bit less than that.\n\nOverall:  I was thinking about the perception specialization, but this course turned me off to that completely.

Some fairly complicated networking topics are not explained with an appropriate level of detail. If you don't have the background on standard routing and switching technologies you'll likely need to do supplemental research to handle the first two projects. \n\nThe tests cover a lot of material and the questions are fairly subjective overall. It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is. Still, they aren't unfair and if you complete the test preparation questions you should be fine.\n\nSome reviews have characterized this course as \"Network Programming in Python\". This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\n\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline. If you just want to know how to write networking code as an applications developer, this course isn't for you.",

For the final project, if you want you can build a working prototype. \nIn summary, this course is writing, writing and more writing.\nThere are 10 assignments and 2 projects. There are two types of assignments P-type and M-type, P is based on principles and M is based on methods.\nLectures are very engaging and drive home the concepts very well. If you have already working in UX and/or designing great apps, then this course will be a cake walk and you just need to spend only 5 to 6 hours per week. However, I come from an embedded background with no UX experience, so all the concepts were new and I needed more time. \nThe strategy that works best is to choose a domain and a problem in that domain that you want to solve and a few apps that you can review. You watch the lecture on a Monday, read the questions to be answered for the assignment, internalize the concept and apply them on everything you do in the next three days, then just reflect on your experience for the questions asked in the assignment.\nWe have two proctored exams and they are a bit tough. Take proper notes while watching the lectures and diligently read all the weekly readings. The readings were made compulsory from Fall 2017 and 1/3 of the questions in the test come from those. As I didn't do the readings, my test scores are not great. \nThis can be easily taken along with another intermediate course, if the other one is full of programming like CV or AI then this writing will complement the heavy programming.",

Assignments also had a concept called Above & Beyond, i never tried A&B, you have to do something extract other than required on that assignment topic to receive A&B which counts for 10 mark. we also had a mid term project which is the replication of an published paper, this was the most difficult assignment of all to me, but if you spend enough time it will be an easy A. we had two attempts at the exam, and exam is easy one but really tricky one, as there are multiple choice questions, if wrong answer selected negative marking is given. choose your final project when you reach mid term itself and start working on it, as much as possible choose an easy topic as you have the liberty to choose the topic.\n\nOver All this class is very good class.",

            "text": "Very well-done course. It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the Analytics program -- you should definitely take this your first semester.  This course does a great job of surveying the world of what most people are calling \"data science\" nowadays -- basic data preparation plus a wide array of both machine learning and traditional statistical modeling techniques. If you put a good amount of time and effort into the homework (and don't just copy the TA office-hour solutions), this class also goes surprisingly deep into some topics.  You WILL want some experience with R prior to the course or you will be spending double the hours/week.  It is also a great idea to get familiar with RMarkdown documents since they are a great format for submitting homework.\n\nAlthough I ended up with an A, my only complaints about the class relate to the grade weighting and some exam questions.  First, the homework and course project are low weight compared to the amount of work required and understanding gained (16% hw, 9% project). In addition, one feels a bit cheated when the course project is merely peer-graded and your peers don't provide much feedback. The peer grading in general was not very helpful as I rarely got any comments, just a numeric score -- I would learn more with tougher HW feedback from an instructor. The exams felt unnecessarily high-pressure and high-stakes, because they were (75% of grade for 3 exams). While about 80% of the exam questions were pretty easy, 5-10% were subtle/difficult, and about 10-15% were just badly constructed -- either expecting us to \"think on our feet\" about applying/combining concepts that only got minimal lecture time, or having ambiguous wording/intent, or relying on a very artificial set-up, or making too many assumptions and providing too little context. Some were major traps for people prone to overthinking.  In addition, the exams leaned toward fewer questions with higher point values each, which can really bite you. Fortunately there's a fairly generous curve that will add 5-6 % points.  In general, if you want a solid pre-curve A, you should do extra reading on each modeling technique covered and your studying should focus more on big-picture, situational application and pros/cons of different techniques. \n\nAll in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a ton.  Dr. Sokol's lecture videos are engaging and clear, including many examples from his own consulting experience. It's obvious he loves the subject too.",

It had 7 assignments, 2 project work (mid-term research work replication & final project) & one final examination (with upto 2 attempts - max considered :))\nThe TAs are vell organized, very passionate & very helpful too. Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical...\nThe only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report. This sometimes makes you feel that some technical challenges resolved/attempted were getting overlooked especially if you are not one of those who are good at reporting :).\nHaving completed more rigourous courses like CSE 6220(IPC), CS6601(AI) & CS6476(CV) where the reporting was not a big factor in determing the grades found this a little discouraging. But on the brighter side, it's gave an opportunity for me to improve on these aspects (which is definitely important in professional life).\nOver & above the computation part, the fun aspect was experimenting with photography... I used the opportunity to get myself a nice SLR (not mandatory for the course) & learnt quite a bit of photography during the last 4 months.\nIf you need a term break from the heavy load ones & want to have some fun along with learning, will recommend this course.

Ok, bleeding-edge might be a bit of a stretch, but you will learn something new :-).  Also, fair warning to those considering this as your first class. This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don't let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don't have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don't have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory. If you decide not to brush up in these areas you can still do well, but it may be a bit of a struggle.  If you have questions during the course, don't be afraid to ask the instructors, they won't bite :-). If I had done this for the first couple of projects of the course, I more than likely would have had a better outcome.  What can I say? This was my first rodeo so I had to live and learn. Exams are very hard and will require a good bit of study time to do well. For my class, they provided a very watered-down version of the exams as a review and that helped a lot. This was my first of two classes in the OMS program and I did learn a lot. Hopefully, this review will be of some help to you and I wish you the best in your future endeavors with this program.

I have a degree in computer science and 4 semesters of calculus, but still could not decipher the mathematical formulas we were given to implement our code.  I easily spent 40+ hours a week, 20+ hours spent trying to decipher the assignment.  Some people claimed they finished assignments (even the final!) in 3 days - I spent every spare minute on my computer from the minute assignments were released to the hour the assignment was due, and I was still lucky to get a B.\nThe course is great, really.  I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies.  The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math.  You've introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go!  The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement.  I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large 'E' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\n\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren't allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn't, and rewriting everything into python.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of time, don't take this course.  You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation.  If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course.",

            "text": "If you are interested in self-driving car technology, and who isn't, you want to take this course.  This was *the* perfect course.  It had a world renown professor, the head of google's self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor.  The TAs are great, on top of every thread.  And if you're into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y.  The answers are given!   You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in.  The TAs are ok with this.  The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it's all simple trigonometry).  This is the best course ever, and the *perfect* introduction to OMSCS.  If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\n\nMy only complaint is it was too easy.  Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math.  Let me address this.  First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven't taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc.  If they found this hard, I don't see how they would be able to graduate.  There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).  \n\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot.  They did not ask 'is there an easier way to do this?'.  They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much.  For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot.  The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter.  But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment.  Why even bother, when it's such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle.  SImple trigonometry will give you the answer.  The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter.  It's non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter.  Again, there is no need to do that!  The EKF isn't even mentioned!  There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason.   Why do unneccessary work like 'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix'?  I have no idea.\nThe only assignments you're not given the answers to are the 3 projects.  There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone.  I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%.  These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason.  Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that's what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route.  But, and I can't emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that.  There's no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want.  You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse.  I can mathematically prove it if you want.\nPoint is, if you're willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you'll do just fine in this class.  I didn't even know python when starting this course and my final grade is 99.5%\n\n",

Professor and TAs are active on Piazza. Good, well-known and communicated structure. Good lectures. Interesting projects. Generous grading. Medium workload, not very difficult. I could not have wished for a better start into the program.\nI will say, however, that there is a lot of writing (in total we had to write 8 essays for a total of about 15.000 words) and reading for peer feedback (24 peer feedbacks in total, 3 for each essay) which means you will read and critique another 120.000 words.\n\nFor me it was perfect to get my writing in shape, get familiar with python which I didn't know before, get familiar with Piazza, T-Square and Peer Feedback in a class that was busy at times but not too bad in total. I recommend taking it.",

Dr. Alan Flury is most likely the biggest jack-ass you will ever meet. He is unable to admit fault with himself, even when he is clearly wrong. He is basically what would happen if you had Donald Trump run a business class. The OMSA program and Georgia Tech should all do themselves a favor and just fire this man.  He is toxic. He is disgustingly rude. He is about as personable as the Ebola Virus. If you misunderstand any concept that is ambiguous in the class, it cannot possibly be his problem, it must be that the students are morons. Or the students just are not getting it. But it is never his issue, it is always ours. If we do have the audacity to say he has done something wrong, instead of admitting his error, he will double down on his wrongness. He gets unnecessarily defensive. I am in complete awe of how a man with such a disgusting behavior is any where close to an academic institution. This man is a disgrace and an embarrassment to Georgia Tech. He runs the class like a prison. He thinks it is better for the homeworks to be these all-or-nothing multiple choice questions that do not help with learning, but test what you have learned through the videos. I feel like he made this class unnecessarily difficult, purposefully. I think he has some deep-rooted Napoleonic Complex that he needs to get checked out by a psychologist. I could go on, but this man is just awful, pure and simple.",

            "text": "I came into this class with little or no background in Python, Machine Learning, or finance. There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can't just skip one and think you'll be fine). \n\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren't finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that's as mature as ML4T can't get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn't seem a good fit for this course. \n\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I'm normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content. \n\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor's responses on reddit were rude. I've taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning. In this class I didn't get that vibe at all. ",

            "text": "This course was very informative, but required a lot of work on the projects and especially on the assigned readings.\n\nThis course covered a lot of OS principles, both historically and relevant to today's environment. It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over).",

There is no helpfulness or positive encouragement provided in learning. Lots of negative responses and sarcasm. First, you need to search and read through all piazza posts before asking your question (to avoid annoying the TAs). Second, you didn't get a straight answer most of the time, so might as well do the research yourself. My take on group project: there will always be someone who doesn't do any work. With that in mind, always focused on your own learning and not worry with what other people do or don't. If you're lucky to find good people, it's a bonus!  if not, that's okay too.

            "text": "This class is definitely a basic introduction to machine learning, with more of the class focused on using NumPy and Pandas and a few financial markets topics.  In terms of difficulty, most of the projects are very straightforward, and Professor Balch provided additional videos that walked through pseudo code or algorithm outlines.  Two of the projects are more challenging, but still reasonable.  I would have preferred that some of the early easy projects be combined to allow for an additional machine learning project at the end.  The huge class size (~700 in the online portion) exposed that there are limits to how high a class can be scaled before execution problems emerge.  This class pairs well with other classes, as long as attention is paid to the higher workload in the last few weeks of the class.\n\nPROS:\n\n--Lectures were clear.\n\n--Professor Balch was active on Reddit nearly everyday.\n\n--The material was interesting and a good example of how machine learning is applied in a single industry.\n\n--There seems to be some measure of updates and improvements each semester, so there is an effort to refine the course over time.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n--The amount of lecture material is light, particularly in the second half of the course.\n\n--Management of the course was often sloppy.  For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren't \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n\n--Professor Balch's tone on Reddit sometimes didn't come across as very encouraging.\n\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren't at all relevant to machine learning.\n\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n\n--Professor Balch's frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren't native English speakers.",

Udacity Video lectures are effective and entertaining, the YouTube videos have important material but are generally too long and not as well structured.

The hardest part of the class for me were figuring out how to start some of the lab assignments we had. A few of the more difficult labs felt like we covered a topic briefly in a lecture, and then we had to immediately work on a full lab regarding this topic. This led to me having a hard time initially figuring out how to start a few labs, and I only made it halfway through lab 5 because I had a hard time understanding Datalog. Even though I didn't do well on lab 5, I did fine on the midterm and final (which I felt were both challenging but fair, the final wasn't cumulative but was harder than the midterm) and got a B in the class.",

            "text": "This class is very hard in terms of lot of things. Firstly, what to expect in the exam, you never know. However much preparation you do for this class is going to be less. In all other courses, we will get to do the projects where we get 1-2 weeks of time where we can figure out what needs to happen. In this course, we need to figure out in 3 hours of exam time. The exams are similar to homework but home works are not easy either, But you will get a week to figure out for homework where as exams can be very tricky. The professor won't ask any questions that does not make you think. He makes you think a lot during the course. The professor gives a lot of good hints on what to focus on during exam times. They are very very important. Pay close attention to what he says. He is very active on piazza and answers a lot of questions. The professor is very particular about dynamic programming. If you do well in this area, you will get A or B. Otherwise difficult to pass. He asks tough questions of Dynamic programming. It is his favorite part of the course. He initially scared the class saying that if we don't do well n dynamic programming, we will not pass. That happened to be true. This class required at-least 30-40 hours of work for me. So, my advice is not take this class with any other course\n\nThe positive thing about the course is, the curve. The B cut-off was 65% and A cut-off was 84% for Fall 2017.  Believe me, 65% is  not easy to get.. But the curve really helps at the end of the course. The text book used for the course is DPV- Algorithms (Dasgupta + Papapi........+Vazirani). Practice ALL problems from the exercise of this book to pass this course. This is a MUST.  Good luck.",

The examples are nice and she brings in some new topics relevant to the modern world (VM, Data Center technology, etc). Generally the course content was a rehash of the undergrad concepts and some new ones. Well balanced and I liked it.\nThe TAs were generally responding, not amazing but good. \nThe negative was the C projects. Whoever says whatever, you need good C and a nice understanding of pointers. I spent very long hours debugging code which I felt was not necessary for the course. I did not learning anything about the OS. I learned about advanced C Programming (which I am not sure was necessary as part of this course). The other thing I felt very arbitrary was the extra points for the project work. The instructions were not clear on what exactly would earn us the extra points. TAs used discretion which did not sit well with me (but again this is my opinion). The final exam was difficult but I was more disappointed with the quality. Some of the questions were ambiguous and not well laid out. I think Professor gave extra points for those questions. \nWill I recommend the course? Absolutely. ",

That was all really interesting to me. My biggest gripe about this course is that I feel the instructors are focused on assignments and grades... rather than students. Maybe it's because I was taking EduTech at the same time, but I felt like the instructors just LOVED taking points off for things like \"video was 30 seconds too long\" or \"Essay was too long\" (the essays are maximum 800 words - it is hard to sufficiently answer the questions without going over) or \"Wrong format submitted\" (even if the assignment guidelines were modified before the due date), etc.\n\nWe worked with an external mentor (a doctor in Atlanta, Georgia) on our project and he was very helpful and very responsive.

The course was nicely structured, with coursework relatively spread out. 1 week HW due, 1 week HW due, 2 weeks for completion of a project. Homework assignments were relatively easy, projects should be started well in advance.  Reading external material helps a lot, and David Silver's lectures felt more detailed for the intro to the course. Recommendation: be intimate with Python; the later projects are much easier to complete in it. All around, the TAs were very helpful in office hours, and Slack becomes your best friend.

I personally spent around 15 - 20 hours during the first few weeks of the course and steadily was able to reduce my time to around 8-12 hours towards the last month or so. The readings are lengthy at times and there are multiple to get through. I found it hard to digest and remember the opinions of each author/researcher, but getting through the readings helped me to better understand the theory behind HCI and the many views around it. Coming from a computer science undergrad and working in industry as a software engineer for several years, this class definitely helps as I have been on the UI/UX side more times then I can count and it's an area that I find doesn't get enough attention in many of the companies I worked with.

The EER diagrams, schema design, and normalization content is useful. Read a book and don't take the course if that's what you're looking to learn. If you haven't done web development, you will learn a lot from the final project which is a web application. The database component is a decent component to the project, but there's a lot of unnecessary UI requirements. Many requirements are arbitrary and not relevant to the database (i.e. drop downs, radio buttons, printable pages, unit conversion).\n\nProject was terrible. It wasn't reviewed for accuracy or the actual technical requirements that students were supposed to get from it. It was refined over the semester, and felt like the instructional team was making it up along the way, which led to a lot of questions on Piazza. No rubrics were provided for the three project phase submissions. Grading is inconsistent. I had a great group, which made it bearable. Choose your group wisely and try to find others that can complement your skills for the project. There's a team formation period so use that time wisely to find others who are motivated and engaged.\n \nExams were fair for the most part. The last exam was pretty tough as some of the questions, especially calculation questions on indexes, efficiency, and performance weren't like those found in the book or sample exam. Still possible to do well if you think through it carefully. Be prepared for 1-2 questions that don't cover the content assigned in the syllabus. Be prepared for 1-2 tricky questions per exam that assess small details that aren't relevant or core to the course material.\n\nInstructors were not responsive. The head TA was pretty defensive in some initial threads which didn't create a welcoming or positive learning environment on Piazza. Many Piazza threads were never answered, including exam questions and project requirements. The instructor asked for feedback in the middle of the course (which many students appreciated including myself) after some students communicated about the negativity on the forums and the somewhat artful deception of the few exam questions I mentioned before. Most of those threads went unanswered even after the instructor said he'd follow up with individual responses.  \n  \nHope positive changes actual take place in future offerings. I'd recommend the class for those uninitiated with web and SQL. A lot of people already familiar with databases tend to not like the course.",

To be honest, I really liked the instructors and their teaching style. In fact, that is the only reason why I liked this class. I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell's book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough. If the students are serious about understanding the lectures, then they need to ensure to have a basic grasp on Big O Analysis, Differential Calculus and Probability Theory before taking this course.",

            "text": "I found this course to be a good introduction to operating systems, especially having never taken an OS course before. Since this is now my 9th course in OMSCS I've certainly run the gamut in terms of quality of courses. That being said, I'd say IOS is one of the better ones (my favourite and best being KBAI) for the following reasons:\n- The video lectures are well organized, the concepts are explained clearly, and quizzes are thoughtful and helpful in reinforcing topics. \n- Instructor and TA involvement was exceptional in Piazza. They fostered a collaborative learning environment which helped bring learning above and beyond just the video lectures\n- The projects were helpful and fun to do. As rusty as I am in C, the projects were a nice refresher and departure from my usual day-to-day work in higher level languages. If you start early on the projects and get involved with class discussions, there's no reason you shouldn't succeed on the projects. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities that weren't hard to complete and ended up saving my grade. \n\nMy concerns with this class:\n- Exams: although mostly straightforward, they were tricky and sometimes required remembering one small lecture detail. The midterm and final exam weren't evenly split over lecture material with the final covering significantly more lectures. In this regard, I highly suggest that you keep pace with the class syllabus. \n- Grades: We received our project 1 and midterm grades back fairly quickly, but didn't get project 3 grades (which was due in the middle of the semester) until nearly after the final. Not having a good pulse on your grade was mildly frustrating. \n- Bonnie: Project submissions are handled through Udacity's testing framework, Bonnie, which had a few hiccups throughout the semester which were eventually resolved. I did like the instant feedback it provided. \n\nHow to succeed and other advice:\n- Keep up to pace with lectures, projects, and reading material. With regards to the reading material especially towards the final, I found that just focusing on the papers that were discussed in lecture were most important. There were some lengthier papers that, although interesting, contained far more detail and concepts than the class exams or projects required. \n- I bought the Silberschatz Operating Systems Concepts textbook but only cracked it open once or twice because the lecture material was complete in itself and Piazza was an excellent supplement for answering questions. I regret buying the textbook, but YMMV. \n- Invest time in setting up and understanding your C development environment. It will save you time in the long run when you're trying to debug a segfault. Use an IDE like CLion (free for students). It helps highlight syntax errors that you could otherwise miss. Learn the basics of vagrant (virtual machine), valgrind (memory leak checker), and gdb (C debugger). \n\nOverall I'd rate this course an 9/10 and would highly recommend it. It wasn't part of my specialization, but I'm happy to have taken it because it rounded out my understanding of basic CS concepts. ",

I felt it is better to start with just visual from beginning which will make life easier as it progresses. Projects require coding in Python. I had not much prior experience but going through the required pillow library once helped a lot. Overall, a normal yet time consuming course to start the program with.

It's as if they simply sought to get credit for answering questions in a perfunctory fashion, not elaborating on the answers beyond what was mentioned in class.  \n\nExams were tough in the sense that they required VERY specific memorization.

First, I have to state that Dr. Isbell, and the TAs: Amir, Sasha, and Pushkar, were extremely helpful throughout this rough journey.

I actually had to complete one of the assignments while running on a portable gas-powered generator, because the electricity was out at my house due to hurricane Irma; where there's a will there's a way.  With a wife, kids, full-time job, putting up hurricane shutters at my house and my parents, being without electricity for a few days, driving all over Miami to find gasoline and propane, and taking Machine Learning for Trading along with this course, this was one hectic semester.  In the end, I miraculously earned an A in both courses.  I must say that I learned a lot in this Machine Learning course, I came into it clueless about Machine Learning, and can say that I acquired a plethora of information in the end.  Dr. Isbell and Dr. Littman cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning throughout this course, at a somewhat deep level, which was great.  Grading is harsh, but don't let this discourage you, just give it all you've got and do not give up.  Complete all assignments and the problem sets, and study hard for the midterm and final.

A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.",

His planning makes it very easy to focus on the content of the course and if you do have questions, answers are swift and sincere. The format is unique in that you are assigned a mentor who guides you through the process of deciding on a project and fulfilling the requirements. There aren't any strong negatives in the course but I suppose the initial project dive is a little rough. There is just so much data to sort through and it is a little hard to pick the problem you want to solve. Fortunately, if you come in to the program with a problem in mind this is a non-issue!\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is what you make of it. You could pick an really easy problem or a really hard problem, the only person you're hurting or helping is yourself.The first few assignments are almost entirely reading academic articles so get good at reading those efficiently. The writing is not that hard as long as you stay on point and have a purpose. My initial project idea was too ambitious but I was able to massage it into something that could be completed in about 100 hours which is the goal. \n\nWorkload:\nI spent a lot of time reading throughout the entire course so that never really goes away. The last 4 weeks was my big dev cycle and I ended up pouring about 25/hrs in the last week or so. My measured average is about 10 and if I had not been taking a second class, I probably would not have had the huge uptick in hours during the last week.",

            "text": "This is an incredibly difficult class with a very large time commitment. The lectures are dense but helpful for the most part. These lectures gloss over some details which force you to read the book which has moments of utility but is by and large, a jargon-riddled dumpster fire. The book uses some dreamed up syntax to express some of the algorithms which is pretty taxing to understand. The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don't get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process. If you can explain your approach, you might be able to retain some points but overall, the homework grading is very strict. The coding portion of the project is massive. Absolutely massive. I think it should have been split into at least 3 projects but that may have slowed the class down and there is a lot of ground to cover. I have no complaints about the project grading or what they asked of us. The project document is pretty vague and you have to interpret and justify a lot of your design decisions, just like in real life :)\n\nThe final was not fun and was pretty much like the homework. Treat the homeworks like a practice exam in order to get a feel for the final. The final grading has a decent curve so don't give up, always submit at least something. The way the assignments are weighted, you can't afford to skip any single task.",

The arrangement of the topics (DP then Graph then P/NP) front loaded the difficulty somewhat so it wasnt too much for me to recover after not doing well on the first exam.

The programming assignments are graded on how fast they run on a high-performance computing cluster. The course material covers parallelization on a shared memory system, distributed computing, and cache performance, and I felt like the class provided a good general intro to these topics.\n\nDr. Vuduc is clearly a passionate educator. He's good at illustrating many of the difficult HPC concepts. The lecture videos have high production quality. The class was well organized and the Piazza/Slack interactions were engaging.\n\nCSE 6220 was my first OMSCS course. I knew it was going to be challenging, but it was harder than I'd hoped. I found the midterm and final to be difficult and grueling. The exams are mostly theoretical / analytical while the labs are obviously practical. There seemed to be a disconnect between these two components of the course. The harder labs took a large amount of time, and I'm not sure how much additional time/energy would have been required to do really well on the exams. That said, if you do well on the labs, you can still get an A even with middling performance on the exams.\n\nI took this course to fulfill a foundational requirement, to challenge myself, and to get exposure to HPC. I came into the class with some light experience in C. I had to spend a lot of time on the labs wrestling with C issues that a more experienced C programmer wouldn't have. I also didn't have strong algorithmic analysis background, which made it difficult to follow some of the analysis portions. Overall it was a hard but good course.

The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm.  The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we'd had project 2, whatever that was) and didn't fall into the trap of being application-specific.  Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.

            "text": "8 projects (67% total) and 2 Exams (12.5%/each) account for the majority of your final grads, the rest points are almost giving it for free. \n\nFor each assignment, you can check the project details here (http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Fall_2017#Assignments). Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation. \n\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\n\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course.",

            "text": "This class is no joke. I had to rearrange my life to have enough time for assignments. You actually program the AI projects that you learn about in lectures. Note that my Python (and especially numpy) skills are at best average, although my statistics skills are good. Fellow students were very helpful on Piazza. Don't forget about Slack, too.\n\nAssignments: Some of the assignments require really strong math skills, most require a decent understanding of probability theory, and all require good Python scripting skills, including numpy.  There were 6 assignments in the Fall 2017 class; you get to drop the lowest grade. The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that. \nExams: take-home exams that take 10-20 hours to work through. Exams actually promote learning the material that wasn't part of the homework, so I liked that about them. Make sure to ask instructors any and all questions you might have. Don't try to get what the question is getting at, or you'll lose all the points for the question. \nGrading: The class is graded on a curve (median and above is A, one stdev below median is a B) but note that the median for most assignments was 100% (midterm and final were much lower, around 75%). For the online section, A ended up being about 87%, and a B was about 74% . Don't bypass extra credit questions if you have the time to complete them (some are very time consuming and others aren't). As the class progresses, you might not be able to complete an assignment, so extra credit on an assignment might be the difference between A and B, or even passing and failing. \n\nOverall, this was a great class, one of my favorites in the program, along with KBAI. If you actually have the prerequisites outlined, you'll spend much less time on it than I have and probably enjoy it. ",

Worked as an electrical engineer in power distribution between now and then. Full-time online student currently. No formal software analysis and test training in academic or work environment. This was one of two courses that I took in my first semester. \n\nCourse Experience: Overall, the course was worthwhile from my personal background. The instructors and TAs are truly excellent in operating the course and helping the students understand the material. The assignments are very effective in teaching concepts and new tools. All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students. Everyone had to fight through the difficulty of obscure environments and languages. I had an abnormally large and painful learning curve for most assignments due to my deficient background, hence the 25 hours a week. Five different languages used throughout assignments, but I was able to figure out the appropriate usage of each given enough time. Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn't implemented before. The concepts and analyses are relevant as well. The exams require application of the knowledge rather than simple memorization. For example, given this type of analysis, find the output of the given simple code rather than recite the definition and characteristics of an analysis. I gave a \"liked\" rating as the lessons I learned on the assignments and exams were truly valuable but often cost me 20% or more on my grade, which can be a difference in a letter grade. Then again, one should have to earn an A. ",

You will use the basics of python for the assignments that are not exceedingly difficult. I simply had to transfer basic coding techniques from C and Java into Python syntax. This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects. Great first course or easier course to pair with a harder one. ",

The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%.",

The exam questions had alot of vagueness and felt were not written that well. The second complaint is that while the TA's were good about answering Piazza questions they were not so great at answering followups on Piazza. A followup question many times has as much meat as the original and kept seeing followups marked as satisfied when they clearly were not.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the class for the material and the projects were a blast and interestingly challenging. Only project I didn't enjoy as much was the virus analysis one. All the rest were really fun and cool. These was the best part of the class.

As everyone says start on the projects early, I program only in C at work, and it's also this flavor of programming style and I had some issues, I can see how other students can spend lots of time on the projects.\n\nThe exams are very hard, and in our semester there has been some mishaps with the questions, and even some answer choices.\n\nOverall though the class is great and is very well curved.

Excellent test cases. Even the py.test files were given so you could see the expected answers for the test cases. Prof encouraged students to share test cases as well.\n2. Professor was very active on reddit. Seems like 50% of all posts were from the prof.\n3. Assignment expectations and deliverables were clear.\n4. Course was well planned and executed. \n<br/><ol>CONS:\n1. Professor's posts were a little rough around the edges. If you have thick skin, then it won't be an issue.\n2. Prof's bully behavior encouraged bad behavior from students as well. Some simple questions asked by students got responses like \"you don't belong here at GT\", etc.\n3. Seems like prof was paranoid about class material leaking to future students. No suggested homework solutions were given. TA's were there to help clarify assignment details, but did not offer real help on homework. There were mistakes in notes, but were corrected in the video lectures (I think this was done to make notes useless to unauthorized people who get hold of the notes; just speculating).",

Although it is a database course, it broadly covers/requires other CS topics like web development, disk management, AMP setup and admin, PHP or Python scripting.  I would only recommend the course for students without much database development experience.  \n\nI am not a fan of the book.  You should get it for the course as a reference and for the exams but don't plan on keeping it.  \n\nThe exams are not difficult but are not easy to get an A.\n\nI like the concept of the project because it demonstrates \"putting it all together,\" but the Fall 2017 semester version was not well executed.  I think the TAs and instructors are taking feedback appropriately to improve it in future semesters.",

Prof Isbell wants you to understand the topics, not regurgigate reports or pay too much attention to coding.\n\nRegarding coding, you can use whichever programming language you want, but there are some recommended languages for some assignments.

There are 3 projects and all required C programming. I expected this class is for OS internal and it is partly correct but it spends much time on concurrency problem (a process and a thread) while it is still very fun.\n\nI felt the latter half of lectures are bit dry, and because we don't have hands-on experience on them (memory management, file structure, spin-lock, hardware related subjects, and memory sharing) through projects, it was bit difficult for me to understand and absorb all of what I was taught.\n\n20 hrs / week is just average and I always tried to complete a project as soon as possible, so after a project is open, I spent 70-80 hrs / week and after I completed it, I go back to lectures and spent 10-15 hrs /week. I recommend the same way if you don't want to be upset at the last moment...\n\nExams were not so easy, you should expect they are more complicated than sample problems. However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\n\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits. This class offers a lot of extra points. I'd recommend visit the Slack channel if you get stuck on projects. TAs are more responsive on Slack.",

What practical insight does it give you besides learning Python Pillow library to scan images and using your own software development approach to do math and compare the images, find similarity and differences. I did find any value from AI or ML perspective in this course. TA's are okay, sometimes their responses are vague, sometimes okay. They like lots of writing on out of the world scenarios. More diagrams, more flow charts and spend lot of time writing and making nice drawings. \n\nThere is a big disconnect between theory being taught and what you are expected to do in assignments. Videos are nowhere connected to assignments. overall not a very useful course if you want to utilize the knowledge in any of the practical scenario.",

            "text": "First class in OMSCS with no academic CS background (though I have an undergrad engineering degree), no C experience, and 2+ years in professional web development.\n\nThis class is extremely well run and I commend Professor Ada and all of the TAs for their efforts to make Piazza and Slack as helpful as possible. The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I'd recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn't bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\n\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I'd caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you'll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you're going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\n\nYes this class is hard and you're going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C.",

            "text": "Amazing course as an intro to OMSA or for anyone willing to get a broad understanding of Analytics concepts and techniques with R language.\n\n- Content-wise, I have found this course very condensed, there is definitely a lot to learn. The online format of the course is very succinct therefore additional readings definitely help in building the intuition. To do so, I have relied on various books, sites and blogs, but also used the discussion forums which are definitely a key to success for this course. This course is greatly designed and the knowledge acquired after finishing this course is definitely its strength. \n- Logistics-wise, on average one homework per week is to be submitted, the difficulty varies based on the content of the course, I have spend 8 to 10 hours a week between the course and the homework. The peer-grading can be frustrating at times, but equally rewarding when receiving a feedback on the submitted homework, which is not necessary the case. The weight of the homework in the overall grade is quite low compared to the level of effort. However, the time spent on the homeworks is useful to prepare for the midterms and the exams, which are more concept-based and of average difficulty.\n- Prerequisites-wise, elementary knowledge of R is definitely helpful to focus on the concepts rather than wasting time learning the language in parallel. Dedicated office hours will also help with R if required. Basic knowledge of math is required but the course is not deep diving into complex math formulas and theorems, which made it easy from that perspective.\n- Course team-wise, the course is provided in the perfect format, appropriate for online learning but still ensuring the quality of traditional academics. Real-life or project examples are shared by Dr Sokol with a pinch of humor throughout the course, which makes it very captivating and interesting as well, beyond the theory. Last but not least, the TAs are VERY present and supportive, which contributed a lot to the success of the cohort.",

            "text": "I took this as my very first OMSCS course by itself, and it was the perfect choice for that.\n\nOne of the TAs described this course as \"a whirlwind tour through Computer Vision\", and I think that is a very good synopsis. It focuses on \"classic\" (pre-deep learning) computer vision, though there is a final project option that uses KNNs. The lectures are countless (after I completed the first one, I thought I was done for the week, but then I looked at the syllabus and realized it was only one out of five for the first week) and dense, so you get a thorough understanding how each presented method works. Not much fluff or handwaving going on here, Prof. Bobick will explain the algorithms and the math involved in detail.\n\nThe problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but also well-designed and motivating. At the end of each of them you'll have something quite impressive to show to your friends or co-workers. About half the problem set points are awarded by the autograder, and the other half comes from the report which mostly consists of images and/or video generated by your code. So if you get all the points from the autograder, you're almost guaranteed to get an A. So the outcome of the course is quite binary: either you don't \"get\" the material or your coding skills are insufficient and you drop half-way through, or you're able to complete the problem sets and get an A or B (the exam being the wildcard). Speaking of the exam, it was open-everything and unproctored, but still quite challenging. The assignments are only released one at a time, so front-loading is not really possible. On the plus side, everyone is working on the same stuff, so the collaboration (on Piazza) is better.\n\nIn terms of pre-reqs, make sure to brush up on Linear Algebra (you should at least know what a system of linear equations is, for example). A little bit of Computer Graphics knowledge is also helpful, but not required. I did Pryby's \"Linear Algebra Refresher\" on Udacity in advance, which taught me Python and Linear Algebra at the same time (without numpy, which I picked up during the course).\n\nIf you have a full-time job, I would definitely recommend not taking a second course with this one (unless maybe if you're a numpy master who does singular value decomposition in his head for fun).",

He is very active in Piazza and slack and gives you meaningful feedback, and detail on why he does what. During this semester they tried a new grading scale, where for projects A's were all 100%, B's were 80%, C's were 70% and so on, meaning that there is no way to get a 90% or a 85%. I didn't really like this because it seemed to penalize borderline work IMO. \n\nOverall this class was a lot of work. It wasn't technical but there was always something due. I felt pretty overwhelmed after a few weeks of trying to balance two classes. I am not sure if this was always the case, but I felt that the previous reviews were sort of a lie.\n\nGreat class but lots of writing and work. ",

Not a must, but helpful. Also, Python programming experience, particularly with numpy, will give you big head start. If you are not comfortable with those the optional programming work leading up to your first quiz is a good way to ramp on the Python & numpy piece. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, my understanding is this class became more difficult starting Fall 2017. As a consequence, instead of being a likely A with relatively low effort it's a likely B. I expect an A, but have done a lot of work to secure as explained next. \n\nOf the course's 7 assignments, 6 are setup that you can reach a maximum of 90% following directions. The remaining 10% - referred to as Above & Beyond (A&B) - requires that you do something else of your own invention related to the assignment. TAs will give suggestions or hints, but this is where you can easily spend 90% of your time and learn the most. Meanwhile keep in mind it's only worth 10% of the assignment grade. \n\nMidterm was difficult and saw 10-15% of the class drop. Implement a selected research paper. Took me more than ~ 60/hrs to do it. Very interesting work however, the sort of thing you'll probably want to share with prospective employers for instance. Mean average was a high C and counts for 12% of your overall grade. Final Project is expected to be of a similar level of difficultly - excepting you choose your research paper to implement for better or worse. \n\nFinal exam is a pain. You get two attempts, 2.5 hours per, and will need all of it. And Notebook quizzes are hard. I expect the Notebook quizzes to improve next semester. The Final Exam however is something that's been used for several semesters running so prepare for aggravation there. \n\nThe Slack channel for the class is very active and was by far the best part of the class. Piazza meanwhile got very noisy with repeat questions. \n\nFinally, get a tripod for your phone or camera if you don't have one. You can get a cheap one for ~ $20.

I have to really highlight that NO instructions were provided.  For example in one of the projects we were required to utilize a well known security tool and you were graded on your implementation of that tool, but no instructions or examples were given and that left some students wondering why they didn't just invest the money in taking a class to learn that toolset from another provider.\n\nIn my case I had to drop because of the time commitments (I work 40+ hours and run a business on the side) and because after getting As on other projects and assignments I received a terrible score on one project and could not recover.  Unfortunately, although I had put in 60 hours of work in and I could demonstrate the logic in my code was correct and met stated requirements, the TAs provided no credit on account of how they expected it to function (requirements that were unstated and undocumented).  Truthfully I received so little feedback and so few instructions that I withdrew in part because I realized I would learn more with my time and money spent elsewhere (ex: CCNA).\n\nAlmost considered dropping the program altogether (I felt the University misrepresented the coursework as something you could maintain with a full time job) but I decided to try another class and see how it goes.

            "text": "The good:  \nThis was the most practical of all the courses I have taken.  You use modern compiler tools, assembly code, optimization techniques that can work for any program, and the stuff about parsing is almost exciting.  Ever write a program that got too big to manage?  Parsing and Intermediate Representations is the answer.\n\nThe bad:\nThe course is run entirely by the TAs.  The instructor does not participate.  You may get lucky, but my TAs were horrible.  They may be very nice people but they cannot teach.  Their English is not the greatest, and the questions they ask are vague and ambiguous.  Without exaggeration, every assignment and project was riddled with typos or mistakes.  And not little ones.  We're talking missing verbs, references to variables that don't exist, output examples being wrong, unstated requirements, or just bad English.  \n\nIf I were to give examples I'd be here all day.  A very simple example is being asked to re-write some code.  I added two lines.  It fulfilled the requirements, and it worked.  I got 0 credit, with the explanation 'Instructions say to rewrite'.  Submitting a regrade request led to more points being taken off a different question.\n\nThese TAs seem incapable of understanding ambiguity.  Depending on how you ask for clarification, you will get conflicting answers.  I tried reducing all piazza posts to yes/no questions, and even then they answered 'yes' to 'can I use string concatenation' and then marked points off for using string concatenation.  Stuff like that, all the time.  If you don't give the exact answer they expect, regardless of whether you met all the requirements or not, you fail.  They are very strict and do not appear to read your explanations.  I think they suffer from TL,DR syndrome.  Considering most of the questions are about invented, imaginary grammar, it's impossible to prove your point to them.\n\nSame thing for projects, with the added complication of partners who went through the same confusion, asked the same questions, and got different answers because they asked a different way.  The lectures are about generic parsers, and are unrelated to any actual work, which made things worse.  Try convincing your teammates that both the TA and the lectures are wrong.  Not gonna happen.  So you stop pushing commits to Git, because they keep changing your code, you end up doing all the work yourself, are accused of not being a team player, and then as time runs out they end up using your code in the end because you knew what you were talking about.  This actually happened to me.\n\nIf you don't care about your grade, and can handle nonsensical feedback/scores, you will learn some practical stuff.  Otherwise this course will make you question your sanity.",

            "text": "Pros: Interesting material! Since it's a domain-specific course (focused on healthcare), we're constantly exposed to real-world applications of the technology. This includes current and historical challenges, and new opportunities. The course incorporates a fun group project working with an external mentor (from the healthcare industry) to create a FHIR app that might actually turn into something. (I cringe at all the throwaway code I write for an OMSCS course, so this was a refreshing change.) The TAs are super responsive and I was delighted how fast the assignment grades came back!\n\nCons: This semester the course has been significantly reworked. The lectures are new and autograded activities have been created from scratch. There were a few hiccups with the activities, but the TAs were always quite responsive and graded generously in these situations.\n\nMisc.: Students are expected to write numerous short-form essays (200-400 words), citing sources using APA format. This was new to most of us, and the TAs were helpful in getting us familiar with it. The autograded activities required Java code written to interface with a FHIR server. If you're learning Java while also learning the FHIR API, expect a few weeks of pain.",

            "text": "The overall presentation of this course left much to be desired. The professors could have been replaced with books and supplementary powerpoints and the course would have been more effective. Instead, we have topics consisting of a string of 20-minute videos of powerpoint readers that, on average, contained the efficacy of prescription-strength Ambien on a warm summer day. Few, if any, of the topics had anything really to do with Analytics as we can expect to use it in real life, and caused students to wonder who was paid off to make the class required. Towards the end of the class I found myself both 1) not learning anything and 2) just trying to score enough points to finish the class...which brings me to grading. \n\nOn grading, there were questions present on homeworks and exams that could have been based on information that wasn't in the printed notes, but touched on during lecture for about five seconds. When lectured on in detail, some of the presentation methods could be construed to be contradictory (or flat-out wrong in a couple of cases) and required confirmation in the human-led sessions. When it came time for the exam (or sometimes even the homeworks), god forbid if your flashcards or whatever memorization method failed you in that time period you immediately lost 1-4% from your final grade. \n\nOne could argue that every part of the class design achieved the needs and objectives, and full disclosure the final score was a mid-B. But looking back, I've completely forgotten some 80% of the course material and paid some good money only to have for three credit hours and traumatic memories to show for it. If Dr. Jayaraman's argument of a happy customers being the most important part of a business's survival holds true, this class needs a complete overhaul to deliver a more positive, conducive learning experience.",

Professor Balch does a great job explaining the finance content without assuming any prior knowledge about trading. I've actually had conversations with coworkers about day trading thanks to what I learned in this course. It is practical!\n\nI found the projects to be enjoyable throughout the semester. They do a good job of building upon each other as the semester progresses, and they're balanced appropriately. The two most difficult (time consuming) projects were spread throughout the semester. The midterm was fair and shouldn't be too challenging to anyone that stays on top of the course content throughout the semester. \n\n**Major pro**: all assignments for the semester were released in draft at the start of the course. This allowed you to work ahead if you knew you had scheduling challenges coming up during the semester. \n\n**Biggest con**: Although the projects built upon one another, we often had to copy and paste code from one file into another. I would have liked the different files/classes to interact with one another a little better. That being said, though, that's a pretty minor con. \n\nThe coursework was never insanely difficult, but it did a great job providing an intro to some ML and RL concepts.

I wrote 5 hours/week here but I am not sure how much it actually was, since I basically just completed every assignment the weekend (day) before it was due.  The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it's not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade.  The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\n\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts.  It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram.  There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project.  The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone's who got a good grade).  All of that was fine.\n\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding.  It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code.  Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required.  Also the videos were weird; I didn't think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren't great.  Also, they didn't always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK.",

Definitely read the textbook as there is material covered on the exam that isn't presented in lectures, only the textbook.\n\nI took this course in combination with Intro to OS.

The lectures were very understandable (too understandable) but kind of long (for the content), the book is just ok - often a savior though, the quizzes sometimes are unexplainably difficult considering the lectures they are attached to, and the assignments are just something else. \n\nIn very short, my main complaint is the amount of material crammed into this course. This course could have easily been broken into at least 2 parts, one probabilistic (Bayes nets, decision trees, others) and one deterministic (A*, constraint programming, adversarial search etc). Unfortunately, with everything thrown in, some stuff will suffer (and is unfortunate, most of the stuff is worth studying more carefully). \n\nA second complaint would be about the lectures. I had a hard time taking them seriously, most of the time prof. Starner and assistants try to paint a relaxed and jokey/fun atmosphere, in some sort of popularity contest style. Laudable try, but unfortunately it made the lectures lack the rigor they needed, which proved a problem for assignments. It was impossible (IMO) to approach any assignment with the lectures only, which presented a problem in itself - if one puts 3-4h/week in lectures, just to have to read another 3h from the AI book, that makes the lectures kind of useless. And one needs all the time possible for assignments. \n\nDon't want to insist too much, but various other things added to frustration: fighting Bonnie (with its arcane errors) for assignments, fighting with TAs about solutions for mid/end term exams, the grading on the curve (\"is it enough a 90% to get an A, when most assignments have 100% as median???\"), opening the course with \"adversarial search\" instead of with actual \"search algos\", and many other small issues. \n\nMaybe I'm too biased already, I would recommend people buy the AI book and study it at their own pace. A lot cheaper and a lot less frustrating. ",

Later you learn Q learners and dyna and use that to the trading problem for the last assignment. Although you get a choice to use some earlier algorithms learned in the class, most end up using Q learner to solve it. It is advisable to learn some Pandas and numpy as they are used extensively throughout the assignments. I had a tough time using pandas for plotting graphs but managed it well in the end. Learning how array slicing works will help a lot. Also learning how to vectorize will shave some secs off your run time and you get bragging rights in slack and piazza for this. Make sure you are active on slack and piazza as tons of great advise are given by some great minds in the class. If not for slack, I would have struggled to understand and approach the problems on my own. And finally, the TAs in this class are a complete joke. You are assigned a specific TA and the one I had did not show up for the Office hour. Barring a few TAs, most don't help much and just ridicule you on Piazza if you ask something obvious. Having said that, I liked prof Balch's humor and approach. He supplemented the udacity videos with some youtube videos and that helped greatly for solving the assignments. Overall a great class.

There is no autograder you have access to - no way for you to know if you've made a silly mistake in your project. Given that it's binary grading (you either get all points for a section or lose it all), you simply are out of luck if you made a silly mistake. Especially if you made that mistake early on, you basically get a 0. \n\nMy advice is to stay away from this course. I feel like I wasted an entire term and learned very little. ",

I was expecting a deeper understanding of these concepts, as well as may be query optimization which are extremely relevant in today's world of distributed computing.

But I can see that if you mess up in picking the team (wide range of tie zones, wide range of capabilities etc.), then you might struggle a bit with projects. However, the project itself isn't too hard. Even a single person can do it. The struggle would be with coordinating between team mates, if you end up with a bad team.\n\nThe reason I say you cannot Front load the work is only because the team project will only move at the team's pace. Rest of the content can be learned quickly.\n\nVery lightweight course. I feel I wasted a course as I did not learn anything new. It is a foundational course though, so that's good.

OS concepts was something I wanted to learn out of OMSCS. This course provided a nice introduction to these concepts, at least to a point where I know where to look for for more information. It is not as detailed as a standard OS course at a top-tier school, though. For example, in my undergrad school, I know that CS majors had to actually write an OS from scratch as the project for this course. This course only requires us to use some of the OS features to implement some applications. This course covers a breadth of information in an easily ingestible way. But it does not go deep into any of the concepts.\n\nBasic knowledge of programming is absolutely necessary. If pointer, references and SIGSEGVs scare you, this course is probably not for you. You don't need to be an expert in C, but you need to be comfortable developing small applications, and with basic debugging. Nothing you can't learn in ~1 week if you already know Java or another equivalent language.\n\nThe instructor, Ada, was fantastic. The lectures were very well made. Ada was available in Piazza to help out fellow students. The exams were great, the TAs were always prompt. All in al, a very well-organized course.

Although I took it in a full semester, I think this would be better as a summer course because there were about 4 \"down\" weeks in the course where I didn't do anything. \n\nThe projects span a wide range of topics, but are very manageable. I thought the 1st project, Buffer Overflow was the hardest if you don't have background in C and memory architecture. The 2nd, Malware Analysis, was very straightforward. The Cryptography project was also fairly easy since you don't have to write your own mathematical algorithms unless you really want to. (So you can make it more challenging if you desire by not using libraries.) Finally, 4th Web Security project definitely seemed very hard for those who had never done any web development. If you have encountered JS/HTML/PHP, it is fine. \n\nThe Canvas quizzes are worth 20% of your grade and open book. So basically, 20% of your grade should be 100% right off the bat. The exams were a bit more random/tricky with some material included that is barely even covered in 2 sentences in the book. I read most of the book, but overall I probably won't retain much since the book is dry and topics are quickly covered. I somewhat regret spending time reading since I don't feel I walked away from the reading with a really deep understanding, but rather with a surface level acquaintance with terminology to pass an exam. I'm sure I will forget all the specialized terminology within a few weeks, hopefully the general concepts stick though. \n\nOverall, it was a fun course.  ",

            "text": "This course is effectively two, so must be reviewed in two parts:\n\n* Part one is taught by Dr. Eric Feron, who is a GT professor. This is the far better of the two course parts. The homework assignments and projects are well-defined and fairly straightforward, if divorced from the content of the lecture videos.\n\n I honestly did not even watch the course videos for the most part, and found them tangential at best to the tasks you're asked to complete. The actual videos are produced well enough but lack any kind of context or narrative thread, so it's very easy to just let it go in one ear and out the other without retaining anything. The Udacity course also commits an imho cardinal sin by embedding multiple videos on a single lesson section and consequently disabling auto-play (which goes back to the aforementioned lack of narrative thread). Ultimately though, as I noted before, this isn't a huge deal because the lecture videos aren't particularly useful -- in fact, the few instances when I did try to reference them to clarify something in an assignment I couldn't find anything pertinent.\n \n The homework assignments varied quite a bit, starting with basically some short Q&A/essays on cyber-physical systems, then going into basically a homework assignment solving a physics 101 problem (calc-based physics 101, to be clear), and then some minor coding assignments in C around black-box testing and input-output feedback loops. The essays required a day or so of work to compile, but neither the physics quiz nor the coding assignments required more than a couple hours work.\n\n Both projects involve commanding either one or a set of [GRITSbots](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2014/11/the-gritsbot/) to accomplish a set of specified tasks, subject to a set of specified constraints, in a MATLAB [Robotarium](http://robotarium.gatech.edu/) simulator. You also have the opportunity to run your code against live robots in the Robotarium for the first project, which is neat but also frustrating, because you're only allotted two attempts in the actual live environment, and will likely find that your robot does not behave live as advertised in the simulation. This is not an issue for grading though, as you are provided a data set to use if needed for the analysis portion of this project, and are graded for code based on the results of the sim and not the live result.\n\n Both projects should be completable with a dedicated weekend of work.\n\n If the _entire_ course was just Dr. Feron's course, I would've probably rated this class \"Neutral\" with an \"Easy\" difficulty. I don't feel like I really _gained_ much from it, but the assignments were for the most part entertaining and it's elective hours.\n\n* Part two is taught by Dr. Jérôme Hugues, who is effectively \"on-loan\" from the Institute for Space and Aeronautics Engineering, part of the Université Fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. He is highly credentialed and active in the CPS field. But don't for a second be fooled into thinking that implies he's effective as an instructor in this course.\n\n As Dr. Hugues is French, there is a language barrier to be overcome for the predominantly Anglophone demographic of the OMSCS program. His lessons and assignments are of course delivered in English -- you don't need to learn French, of course -- but his spoken English _is_ heavily accented and difficult to understand, and his written assignments often lack precision.\n\n Whereas the assignments for Dr. Feron's portion of the course were well-defined and had explicit questions and/or objectives, Dr. Hugues' assignments were exclusively _extraordinarily_ vague and open-ended questions, as though he's attempting a Socratic descent into teaching the material. That works _great_ in an open classroom setting where students and mentor can collaborate on exploring the topic. It is not at all appropriate for a graded assignment for which you're only allowed one submission.\n\n As another review noted -- and I don't know if this is just a cultural misunderstanding or actual personality -- Dr. Hugues can also be quite brusque when you attempt to ask for clarification. He often declines to answer questions outright, asserting that it's deliberately vague so that you can decide how best to answer (but how can I answer when I don't understand the query?).\n\n It could just be that I am not a smart individual, and certainly some students in the class were able to complete his assignments, but for both of them I found myself completely lost and in the mindset of \"I understand the individual words you've used, but I can't put them together into coherent entities that make sense in my brain.\" I've spent days trying to dissect his project and still don't understand what it is I'm intended to do. I suspect that, given Dr. Hugues' background, he just assumes a _lot_ of systems engineering background as common-sensible, which is probably a valid assumption at his home institution with his home target audience, but _isn't_ valid in a computer science course that has, at best, only an informal prerequisite of anything of the sort. I sure as hell don't, and I'm suffering mightily from it.\n\n It is worth noting that Dr. Hugues' portion of the course does not begin until _after_ the drop date, so Dr. Feron's portion can easily lull you into a sense of false security about where you stand grade-wise. With a _perfect_ score in the course going into drop day, I'm now basically assuming zero credit on all of Dr. Hugues' assignments and hoping I can perform well enough on the final (I think I can, since it is, I believe, prepared by Dr. Feron) to maintain a C.\n\n Consequently, for Dr. Hugues' portion of the course I would rate \"Strongly Disliked\" and \"Very Hard\" in terms of difficulty: I have learned nothing and gained nothing but frustration from it. I _do_ think that if you were able to surmount the language barrier, expand this to a full course on its own merit, and assume less in terms of prerequisite knowledge, this _could_ be an effective course. But absolutely not as it currently stands.\n\ntl; dr: Take this class at your peril. If you have an EE or systems engineering background you're probably going to be fine. If you don't, or have never worked on cyber-physical systems before, this is probably not an appropriate first course. (No, [6263](https://omscentral.com/courses/CS-6263) is not ample preparation.)",

I approached the Office of the Dean of Students, they checked the supporting medical docs and forwarded my absence request to the prof. SImulataneouslY I made a private post on Piazza, asking for an extension (2 wks) of a P1 (a deadline had passed before). A TA asked me to fwd a message from the Office of the Dean of Students with a statement that after I do this, they would approve my extension. I did what I was asked for and nobody replied anymore. Tried to remind them, tried to escalate to the prof., no reply. I ended up withdrawing from the course (1st time in the OMSCS, after 7 courses passed with As).",

            "text": "<b>EDIT 2:</b> Project 4 grade received on May 4 in the late morning and apparently I was not suspected of cheating.  A simple update on Piazza could have saved me, and probably many others, a lot of stress.  I still stand by everything else I said below in the original review and edit 1.\n\n<b>EDIT 1:</b> As of May 4, I have to downgrade my review from \"liked\" to \"neutral\" due to some stressful communication issues.  We were told on May 1 that all project 4 grades were expected to be returned later that night.  Also on the night of May 1, we were told that the instruction team found out some students used past projects on GitHub to complete project 4.  After this, the instruction team basically fell silent with very little exception.  Like many others, I don't have my project 4 grade yet.  I didn't cheat on project 4 or at all in this course, so the fact that I have neither my grade nor even the smallest relevant update from the instruction team is getting very frustrating and making me anxious, especially since it's now been 2.5 days since we heard anything relevant.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  My mind is racing at the thought of all the ridiculous hoops I'll probably need to jump through to fight a wrongful cheating accusation, and it's causing a lot of unnecessary stress.  Take this course with caution.\n\n<b>Original review:</b><br/>\nThis was a great course and was not too demanding. There are 10 open-book quizzes, each worth 2% of the grade. Almost every question is verbatim from the textbook or lecture notes. There are two closed-book exams worth 10% each. They were on par with the quizzes in difficulty, maybe a little more so since notes weren't allowed and they covered more material. The final exam was not cumulative. There were four projects, each worth 15%. The projects were some of the most interesting and fun I've ever done in CS, as an undergrad or grad student. We had about a month to do each project, which is <b>way</b> more than necessary. For that reason, IIS is a fantastic course to pair with another course.\n\nProject 1 is all about buffer overflows. Knowing C helps a bit but is by no means a necessity. It's probably more important to know about internal memory architecture at a somewhat high level. This project was definitely the most time consuming for me, and I think I can objectively say it's the one with the most amount of work. (P4 might be more work if you have literally no web dev experience.)\n\nProject 2 is about malware analysis. I'm not that interested in malware but I still enjoyed working on this project. It was a massive decrease in difficulty and workload from project 1 also. No programming required for this project; it's all with a tool in a provided VM.\n\nProject 3 is about cryptography. This one was awesome. Some basic cryptographic algorithm programming in Python. Previous knowledge of Python will absolutely be helpful, and even if you don't there is plenty of time to learn it before the deadline. A ton of guidance is given and a lot of the code is already provided.\n\nProject 4 is about web security and exploiting XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, and doing an SQL injection. This one was extremely easy if you have previous HTML and JavaScript experience. There is some PHP code in the files we're provided, so it helps to know that a bit. But if you have previous programming experience then understanding the PHP code will not be an issue. Also, the only code we actually had to write ourselves for this is HTML and JavaScript.\n\nReally cool stuff. The textbook is dry AF and probably the worst part of the course. The lectures were so-so but informative. Mostly absentee professor on Piazza, but seriously, who cares? We learn material from the professors' lecture videos, not from their Piazza posts.\n\nI definitely recommend taking this class. If you're lucky, your Piazza forum will be filled, like it was this semester, with highly entertaining posts from people constantly whining about the dumbest things, largely because they can't read/follow instructions or they need some serious hand-holding and spoon-feeding.\n",

Still ended up with a high B in the class since I did well on the projects up to that point.  Just stay on top of your stuff and you'll be fine.\n\nI loved this class and absolutely recommend it.

            "text": "Love, love, love this class!  A very gentle and applied introduction to ML.  It also teaches you NumPy and pandas from scratch.  There is a lot of info about this course publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/.\n\nThere are 8 projects in the class, and for the most part they increase in difficulty as you go along.  The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects.  But it makes sense because they're supposed to serve as introductions.  All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do.  I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn't hurt me in this class at all.  It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results.  Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\n\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later.  For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course.  They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part.  We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal.  The biggest change that I remember is in the second project.  We had to optimize something different from the previous semester's students.  Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change.  People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\n\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final.  Both are closed everything.  The final is not cumulative.  The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms.  It sounded like that won't always be the case.\n\n3 textbooks.  One is required and is co-written by the professor.  It's fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read.  You'll definitely want it for the midterm at least.  The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell.  I can't remember if those two were actually required, but I didn't find them completely necessary.  The lectures were enough.\n\nIt's often said that a finance background is helpful for this course.  I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one.  I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot.  I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you're new to it.\n\nThat's kind of true of the course in general.  It's not that this material is difficult, it's just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan.  If you have a good background in Python or trading then it'll be less work, of course.\n\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.  Also, this course potentially pairs well with other courses, depending.  I paired it with IIS and had no problems.  If you have no Python background and no trading background then I don't recommend taking it over the summer.  But, I do recommend this course in general overall.",

I had zero experience with both Pandas and Numpy and still only spent 5-7 hours every week. I also enjoyed the finance theory aspect. It made me appreciate the finance side of things more than I thought I would have.\n\nThe course itself will teach you not a lot new if you know even a bit about ML. The Q Learning RL project is interesting but is dealt with at a basic high level. I wish we spent more time on reinforcement learning.\n\nThe trading part is basic for an ML course focused entirely on trading. Yes we build some technical indicators to trade on but don't expect to learn anything cutting edge for finance. No Deep Learning. No discussion on high speed algo trading strategies. I wish we were trading in a simulator in real time for our final project or at least had a Kaggle final project. That would have been cool.\n\nThis is a good course if you're looking to get your feet wet in ML/Python but if you already took AI, RL and ML then it can be redundant. I recommend taking this course early on in your OMSCS career before you venture out to the other ML classes as it will be good prep for some of the harder courses.",

The examples and explanations are well-chosen and clear.\n\nThe individual assignments are good, but I think there's too many of them. All assignments are writing assignments with ~1200 words. I felt like I was jumping through a lot of hoops each week to complete all the assignments. I like the P Assignments on design (P)rinciples better than the M Assignments on (M)ethods. It's a fun course overall, and it gets you thinking about how people interact with technology in the real world.\n\nLots of required readings. Questions on the exam cover lectures and readings. I recommend taking notes on the lectures and the readings since exams are open-note.\n\nLike all of Dr. Joyner's classes, the communication on Piazza is well-organized and constant. The course hums along smoothly. The grading was a bit slow this semester, but many TAs fell ill or dropped off which is understandable.\n\nDefinitely recommend this course!",

            "text": "**Important note:** I took another course which was very time consuming (not GA) as well while I was taking this course, so that may influence my view of this course as well. And just for you to know I had taken more than half the labs of  this course and all OMSCS ML-related courses before day 1 of this course.\n\nDo you want to learn Big Data? OK, then take the best course or MOOC you can find online or offline or start some coding by yourself. Don't take this course. That's my best advice. Why?\n\n- **Professor is almost never around.** This is perhaps the biggest issue, and from my point of view, where all the other problems come from (he just doesn't see what is going on). You don't see him around in Piazza and he doesn't respond emails. I've been in other very few courses where professor is never around, but this course takes it to the next level. He participates with teams when it's time to start the project though. I can attest that.\n- **It's outdated.** They use spark 1.3 in virtual environment for homeworks. Latest spark version by the time of this writing is 2.3. So, it's mainly focused on RDDs, which is being left behind in favor of DataFrames. You can still use DataFrames in spark 1.3, but it's not mature enough. The same happens to other tools used. Some of the tools are not even the most used tool of their type out there. So sometimes you feel like you're learning it for academic purposes mainly or to get the grade. Having to give almost 40 hours every week to something like that can be frustrating.\n- **Feedback takes a long time to arrive**. There were times I had to wait a lot to get an official response, way more than other courses. TAs do this, I don't remember having seen professor do it.\n- **Fighting against environment**. They give you an environment you have to set up at the start of semester. It's good help, but you'll end up fighting that environment the rest of the semester.\n- **So much work is worth very few points**. 4 Homeworks take lots and lots of hours every week, but they are worth 10% of the whole grade each. Only 40% of the grade after 8 weeks of no social life, maybe 200 hours of work or more (each homework is given 2 weeks).\n- **Forget you had a family.** Your family will miss you for the whole semester. If you have a spouse, he/she won't be happy you decided to take this course.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is one of the **most important subjects for Machine Learning Specialization** because of how often you are asked to know this stuff for a job, and I liked the fact that GT had a course on this. I waited to have a good amount of ML knowledge before taking it, and I think the intention is good, but this course needs a revamp desperately and a professor with time well spent on Piazza.\n\nThis course was way too hard, and half of it was because of the wrong reasons (getting environment to work correctly, lack of documentation, lack of lecture on subjects needed for homeworks). \n\nI think they are thinking in improving this course, hope they do. I could have taken 2 other courses in the time it took to finish this course.\n\n",

The subject matter is dull and the lectures make it even worse, there are two 'required' books which I never touched, the TAs/professor got combative with people in Pizza on a few occasions, and there was almost no interaction at all.  I mentioned the books.  I never once opened them, but I got an 'A' in the class.  I've no idea what is in them, but clearly it wasn't needed.\n\nBy far, the best part of the course are the projects, but that isn't much of a compliment.  The things are terribly designed, require janky industrial software (seriously, why is industrial software so terrible), and have unclear requirements.  Once you've figured out what you are being asked to do, however, the projects are simple and can be finished in an hour or two.\n\nBeware the exams.  They are easy (like 5-10 minutes easy), but there is often misleading wording to questions.\n\nIs this an easy class?  Yes.  Does it require much thought or time?  No.  Will you still be sad you took it?  Very much so.  \n",

They are very open ended, and the steps to complete them are left to the student to figure out, but generally speaking, you know when you've got it right thanks to well defined completion criteria or provided test data to compare against. The first project requires GDB, which I'd never used before. If you're comfortable with debugging in any language, this should be no problem. Knowing JavaScript, HTML, DOM, and some basics about how the event model works in a browser is very helpful for the last project. The weekly quizzes actually help learn the material because you can take them over and over. I took them at the beginning of the week, then looked for the answers while reading the text and watching the lectures. Then you can get a 100% by taking it again at the end of the week. There are two proctortrack exams that follow the same true/false and multiple choice format of the quizzes. They are not difficult, but some of the questions are poorly/awkwardly worded in a way that was frustrating. Getting the text book is required as many questions for the quizzes and exams come from the text and are not explicitly covered in the lectures.",

            "text": "CS-6262 is my first course at GaTech (online), and the course was disheartening. I was very motivated and wanted to excel. I watched every single weekly video and read all suggested materials. I took many notes and was very serious. However, this course is a complete pleasantry. Let me explain.\n\n1) The weekly videos are someone reading the slide without giving any content. The slides are extracted from whitepapers and mostly just the first paragraph of each subject. The videos do not explain; they give outlines of many topics.\n\n2) Each week has too many covered subjects. It's tough to understand everything with the lack of material. Whitepapers are not clear, long to read and a lot of additional web research is required. Videos took me about 1h on average to consume and white papers about 10h. The remaining time was invested in projects.\n\n3) Projects are not related to the lectures. In fact, the projects cover one topic of about 30 discussed in the three weeks the project cover.\n\n4) TAs only answer project answers. Several questions about whitepapers were never answered.\n\n5) Projects are not well constructed. Lots of information are given during the timeframe of the assignment making people working late on the project with a considerable advantage. Some projects requirements were written over +70 PowerPoint slides.\n\n6) Quiz answers are all available on Internet. \n\n7) Final tests are made to trick you. Many questions were related to a subject seen, but the question was touching an area not covered by the lecture. You had to know about the subject deeply to answer. The final exam had many errors (English and structural).\n\n8) Projects worth the most in this course. 5 of them took between 20 to 45 hours to complete. Spread over 2-3 weeks per project it becomes a burden with the whitepapers and videos. The two combined explain why I have an average of about 22 hours per week.\n\n9) Prof Lee is entirely absent from this course. The TAs are doing their best, but they are swamped by assignments questions which prove the lack of cleanliness as well as the disconnect between the material and the projects.\n\n10) They mention buying a book (200 pages). After reading half of it, I realized that it was a waste of time and money. There was a single page that was barely usable for a single project. A student asked about the book and no TA, neither the professor answered about how important was the book was for the class.\n\nIt was my first course, and if GaTech is running this way, I'll stop. The quality is deficient of this course, and it is evident that there was no real intention to teach anything else than cramping a lot of subjects in little time to make it hard. I do not see the point. I put the difficulty to hard only because of the lack of cohesion between the assignments, the lectures and the project. The content is not hard per say, but it is built to make you fail.",

If I had known then what I know now, there's no way I would have considered taking it.\n\n1) The content is poorly organized. There's little structure or hierarchy to the topics. It's a random smattering of things. \n2) The depth is shallow. The quizzes are inane.\n3) The assignments are either borderline trivial, or frustrating due to tricky technicalities.\n\nI don't fault the TA's or the instructor. I believe they are doing their best with what they were given. I think they have tried to make incremental improvements as time has gone on, but there really is no saving it.

The material is basically a frankenstein of business undergrad core classes in managerial & financial accounting, marketing, finance, entrepreneurship and management. If you enjoy long, dry videos, powerpoints with clipart diagrams and a punishing method of grade distribution, this is the course for you.  \n\nWhile the material may be uninspiring, the course structure is something the instructors could easily fix. There are 6 opportunities to earn points throughout the entire semester, which leaves very little room for error. Additionally the exam questions are full of opaque wording and seemingly arbitrary distinctions. Some questions ask you to select all the potentially correct answers from a list many options with no credit for partially correct answers, a decision which is truly baffling to me. \n\nThe instructor is responsive on Piazza at least, however that doesn't make up for the fact that the course is bad. Take your vitamins and power through it if possible. Make sure you're on top of your game on the homeworks and especially the two tests since they account for 80% of your grade, or else you may get a second crack at it when retaking the course. ",

            "text": "One of the best class on OMSCS that I've had. Something to keep in mind is that this class is a survey class. It goes over on a high level the various major topics pertaining to Machine Learning but if you want to dive in deep there are other classes like Reinforcement Learning itself. The projects are a great way to learn more about how things really work and I do highly recommend that you steal code for this class rather than writing it from scratch (yes this is allowed and encouraged for this class). It'll save you a lot of time and gives you more time to play around and write your actual analysis (which is basically the entire score for your projects).\n\nThe lectures are great for me at least, but I do know of a few people who did not like the banter between the two professors. The extra readings, while not necessary, I believe is a great supplement to the lectures. Do read them to expand your understanding but is not really needed for the tests. All in all, a great class!",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n** AS OF SPRING '18 THIS IS BOTH AN II ELECTIVE AND A FOUNDATIONAL COURSE **\n\nA fine class from Dr. Joyner, who stayed involved throughout and should be a model for the profs in other courses who basically let their TAs run the asylum.  10 weekly assignments,  one individual and one group project, two totally open book tests, and a 'class participation' grade (point for Piazza posts, peer reviews, and participating in surveys by other class students).  You are assigned three student papers at random weekly to review; these peer reviews are likely the least effective thing in the course with many of your fellow students offering a whole sentence or two as 'feedback'.   You also have 3-5 required readings each week which reinforce the Udacity lectures (well done by Dr. Joyner, updated frequently).  There is no programming required.\n\nThe basic course structure entails learning the principals and methods of HCI, with weekly assignments being split between the two tracks.  Assignments are used to demonstrate a grasp of concepts prior to the projects which put you through re-designing an interface of your choice.  Workload is manageable, allow a couple of hours for the readings, 1-2 more for the lectures, anywhere from 2-6 for the assignment/projects.  You do have to allot 4-6 more hours early in the semester to take mandatory Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training.\n\nThe grading system is a work in progress; this semester, assignments and projects were graded on hard A-B-C-D-F basis with an equal number of points for each grade (e.g. for a project worth 150 points, each grade gets you 37.5 points).   Tests were multiple choice with you receiving 1 point for each answer you correctly selected or did not select.  For some reason the grade scheme allowed basically anyone to get a B because the total number of points to get a B was 626 of the available 1000 points (63%).  An 88% overall grade gets you an A.  There was a TA shortage as the semester progressed (several had to drop for one reason or another), so grading slowed substantially the second half of the semester.  The TAs were basically invisible other than grading and the very occasional answer on Piazza, but their absence was not felt because Dr. Joyner was so engaged.   NOTE:  Dr Joyner today (6May18) said that this will be the last semester of the letter grade experiment, so expect a return to traditional point-based grading.   \n\nThis was a very enjoyable course thanks to the energy and enthusiasm Dr. Joyner displays for the material *and* online learning. The material was interesting and the concepts are certainly something you can use in real life.  This course was just added as an II elective and I would recommended it for those seeking that specialization.",

I very early considered dropping the course cause I did terribly on the first exam. However, I stuck through it and am expected to get an A now. I hadn't taken the old CS 6505, but from what I've heard it was crazy difficult with its proofs. In this class, there is little to no emphasis on formal proofs. There is a bit of proving NP-completeness at the end of the course, but it's not very rigorous I'd say. The key to the course: study, study, study.  If you study as much as you can for this course, you'll get a B or A. If you don't put in the hours, you will likely not do well.",

In the end, I did not get much out of it. In addition, the course lectures include many interview videos which are often lengthy but do not provide much academic values to the topic.

Phase 3 is a huge amount of work, and the final test 2 weeks later is the hardest of the semester.  You'll spend hours upon hours on Phase 3 and that final exam.  The whole class is structured around designing and building a database-backed application (like many websites you might have used).  It is a lot of fun to work on Phase 3, since it's all about implementing something using MySQL+PHP, Python, etc that you've been designing all semester.  But the graders are rather tough about the first two phases having the diagrams and pseudocode being perfect, when in reality a lot of the pseudocode gets changed when actual implementation occurs (at least in my case).\n\nAll in all it's a good class, and the workload you have really depends on your group.  But it's more than you think, and I don't recommend taking a second class with this.

            "text": "This was my first class in the program and I absolutely loved it. Coming into this I was hoping for a solid introduction to OMSCS, computer science, and C and I would say that it was very successful on all fronts. I’ve consolidated my thoughts / tips about the class below based on topic.\n\n#### Projects\n1. The project code always contains a base set of functionality which you enhance. PR1 for example gives you most of the code for a working C program, you just need to cover the business logic (creation/parsing of a GETFILE protocol message). \n2. TA’s always provided the CMakelists file if you prefer to use CLion and that also makes things easier. \n3. _PR1 – GETFILE PROTOCOL_\n  1. I had very little C experience before this and I was a bit scared coming into the first project. Consequently, I began PR1 as soon as I could and finished about two weeks early. I spent a lot of time in the beginning establishing best practices for how to do things. It forced me to work slowly and do a ton of research on various C aspects, but by PR3-4 I was very confident in my C ability.  \n4. _PR2 – Extra credit research project_\n  2. I went above and beyond and did the experiments, which was not required. It took me about 4 hours to complete. \n5. _PR3 – Shared memory-based IPC_\n  1. This one was pretty easy for me. I completed it in about 6 hours total, including both parts.\n6. _PR4 – RPC_\n  1. This program is basically PR1 and PR3 where RPC abstracts all of the communication. It’s pretty easy, but took me about 12 hours to complete because I stumbed on the MT section. \n\n#### Knowing C\n1. I was completely new to C coming into this and excited to get some exposure. The first project will force you to use strings. Working with strings in C can be challenging. If you're like me and eager to learn new lower level languages, this class is perfect for you. \n2. The other thing that was pretty complicated was the implementation of a thread pool. You don't have to do it like this, but in terms of performance its the best way. Once you get a working thread pool implementation, you can use it for subsequent projects in the class. \n\n####  Tests\n1. Test 1 – 25% of your grade. I found it harder than the second exam. Median was a 76%.\n2. Test 2 – 30% of your grade. IMO, it was easier than the first exam by a long shot. \n\n####\tTAs\n1. Overall, the TAs were highly responsive, but very shame based. I suppose it’s an industry problem. The expectation is that you know the readme very well. Questions about well defined things on the readme or C related questions you can google will get you ridicule. Always try to find the answer on your own before you ask. \n\n####\tTips\n1. Use the study guide to study for the test. It seems obvious but, I studied everything I could get my hands on for the first test and felt like I made it much harder on myself. I found that other students were doing similar things. Since this is an introductory class, there are certain topics in which the rabbit hole goes deep. Make sure that you’re studying the material as it relates to GIOS. \n2. I would strongly recommend using CLion. They make an IDE for every language used in the OMSCS program and its heavily used in the industry. I ended up installing this on my Ubuntu VM and using it from there.\n3. There is a slack for this class and I would recommend it. The TA’s are very responsive. \n4. I would recommend the environment setup they use. I tried doing PR1 on my mac and had all sorts of problems. \n5. For debugging, there are a few tools which will make your life easier. I found these to be most helpful:\n  1. Telnet – must have for the first part to test your server before you finish the client\n  2. Wireshark – to confirm whether client or server is breaking\n  3. CLion debugger – self explanatory\n6. There is always a performance metric component to the test. These are based on the readings assigned during the semester. Know those very well, it’s low hanging fruit on the exam. \n7. Execution flows are a big part of this class. If you don't understand the math, I strongly recommend that you draw out the flow. The questions on the test are usually small enough that you can draw them out to achieve the answer. This is what I did for test 1 and 2 and it worked out well. \n8. At the end of the class, they added a lot of material and I felt like the amount of time required increased per week. Take this into account after the midterm and stay on-top of your lectures. \n9. \tSome of the last readings are unnecessary and very long. The RPC reading, for example, is unnecessary, dense, and 40 pages long. Since it was not present on the study guide, I skipped reading it altogether and it paid off. ",

Good TA assistance on assignments using R.\nDo brush up your knowledge about linear algebra and basic stats for a better understanding.\nHomeworks take a long time and only grades 16%.  Peer review many times is subjective and can't respond to reviews unless you have been graded pathetically in which scenario you have to go via TAs for re-evaluation. 3 peer reviews on each assignment. Some people are just mean in the review processing.\nYou will learn from other a lot during reviewing other's HWs.\n3 midterms are fair but tricky on wordings and make you overthink.  Questions are graded with high weight and a wrong answer can cost you equivalent to 4 HWs.\nMake sure you understand concepts and applications to get good marks in midterms.\nThe project is easy but again subjective nature of peer review is something can take out your points for no reason.\nRubrix for the project is not well defined. \nOverall contents of videos are good. Make your own notes and be active on Piazza and slack. \nTA's are doing a very good job and always got the answer to questions within few hours. Even Dr Sokol answers and guides when needed, which is really great.\n\nOverall great course, you learn a lot. \n\nI usually used to spend 30 min every day (give and take) in reading material for the week and spending on HW during weekdays and weekends more like 10(+) hours in self and deep study and homework.\nSome homework used to be longer and can take more hours, so in general demands on an avg 20 hrs each week.\n\n\n",

Most of the homework was subject to an Above and Beyond rule limiting the grade to a 90 without extra effort. The best approach to get full credit was to find a research paper related to the assignment and implement. The grading scheme makes a B average fairly straight forward to obtain, but requires significant extra effort throughout the semester for an A. The final exam was full of 'trick' questions and no curve, so it was important to go in with a high average if shooting for an A.",

I would definitely not recommend following the approach that I did though by thinking I could pick up C on the fly; as far as I can tell, I spent *way* more time on the projects than most of my peers, and most of that time I was way out in left field anyway. If you're _still_ determined to take this course without knowing C first (hey I get it, I was stubborn too), then do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/) (I found one pretty cheap at a local used books store) right now, because it'll be your lifesaver for the first few projects.\n\nThat said, even though I really struggled with the programming assignments, I still really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot from it. The lectures are great: clear and easy to follow; the professor actually does office hours every week and goes over some great and useful stuff; the TAs are super helpful (and a pretty funny and entertaining bunch on Slack!); and all-in-all the course was very well organized. I am definitely going to miss this class!",

            "text": "I came into this class with very minimal coding experience (just blitzed through about 2/3rds of 1301 in the month before this class began). As a result, I found this course to be very difficult. Many people in the class had significant programming experience, so probably didn't have as much difficulty. But even for these, there were challenges.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, you have a weekly jupyter notebook with roughly ten exercises to complete. These aren't too bad and one can often google their way through them. In fact, for all of the homeworks, I only missed one exercise. In the end, my homework score was 99.5%+. Homework counts for 50% of the grade.\n\nThe workbooks are released two weeks before they are due. So get yourself a bit ahead in the beginning and make a habit of turning them in early. Much less stress that way, for me at least. It was common to see people on Slack, Sunday night before homework is due, asking questions about the first exercise. Not sure what they were thinking.\n\nThe exams, though, were a different animal. For those, you'd get about twice as many exercises (usually 20-25) and could be significantly harder than the homework. AND, you had 24 hours (for the midterms) and 36 hours for the final to complete them. This resulted in marathon work sessions for most of us. In fact, in a poll we created in Slack, the average time spent on midterm 2 was about 17 hours. In my case, I did absolutely terribly on them, but, with the homework counting for so much of the grade, I was able to at least pass the class with a mediocre grade. \n\nIf you have significant coding background (or a strong natural aptitude) you'll be fine. But if you're like me, get ready for a lot of work and stress. \n\nIndeed, my biggest criticism is that I've never been in a class where there was such a disconnect between homework and exams in terms of performance. Usually, if one is doing well with homework, one should likewise expect to succeed on the tests. That is definitely not the case here. \n\nGood luck",

The class was very disorganized with many poorly communicated corrections and changes through the semester.

The activities are rudimentary and don't provide much benefit other than following directions and using trial and error to get things working.

            "text": "Overall: Great class - it's so applicable to the real world that I would frequently learn something in class and hear about it within my job within a couple weeks.  (I am a new member of a data science team).  Dr. Sokol structures the lectures well to be informative and efficient.  Bonus: dad jokes.\n\nHomework:  Challenging at first without R experience, but you quickly learn how to handle the language and to debug problems that pop up - plus, the TA hours and ability to work with peers helps tremendously.  I am a strong believer in Dr. Sokol's statement that we will continually need to learn new programming languages and packages in our career, and so being thrown into things without being hand-held is vaulable and realistic.\n\nProject - Fairly simple, though peer grading makes it a bit scary!  NOT a group project, which I appreciated.\n\nExams - While I received decent grades, I will say the exams were tricky (mostly #2 and #3).  Dr. Sokol knows how to write an exam to make sure you REALLY know the information more than surface-level.  Some questions are easy to interpret incorrectly, and that is my only gripe with the class.\n\nPrereqs - While there are technically prereqs for probability, linear algebra, calculus, and programming experience, the primary one that you need is some programming experience.  Coming in completely blind to programming would have been a significant handicap. Probability, linear algebra, and calculus are fairly minor (though not COMPLETELY invisible - eigenvectors and the calculation of linear, convex quadratic, general convex, and non-convex equations all do come up).\n\nOverall - definitely recommend this class, even as a standalone for non-degree students.

The class is a lot of work, but the TAs are very helpful through Piazza and Slack.  Exams are challenging, but doable with a generous curve.  Definitely study:  review the assigned readings and lectures.  Exams used ProctorTrack but were open notes/book/internet.  The instructor (Prof Vuduc) was great, but only showed up for a couple of the office hour sessions.  I would have liked more interaction with him.\n\nA few things that I disliked:  it felt like there was a lack of feedback on graded work.  For the projects/labs, many times implementing algorithms as presented in class would not get you 100% on the lab (but you could still get an A or B fairly easily).  You need to be creative or research some methods to speed up your code (grades are based on run times).  After the grades were returned, there wasn't really much discussion on ways that people were able to get full credit, so I felt there was an opportunity for more learning that was missed.\n\nSome of the later projects had a few issues with cluster being temperamental - no fault of the teaching staff, but definitely frustrating for the students.  Our grades were based solely on run times, but we couldn't actually get accurate timings on some of the labs.\n\nFinally, the exams are notoriously difficult.  Midterm was 60 points, but only graded out of 50, and the prof recognized that no one would even get close to 60 points during grading.  An additional (generous) curve was added after grading was complete.",

            "text": "This course has been an incredible source of stress, anxiety, and frustration. Though I expected the work to be difficult (my courses last semester in the OMSA program certainly were), it has bordered on impossible at several points given the unreasonably complicated nature of the work we are assigned.  I spent more time decoding confusing instructions and being my own IT support this semester than I did working on any visualization projects or concepts. I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren’t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\n\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash. \n\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\n\n\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\n\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.  I understand that Tech’s rigor is a part of its great reputation, and fully expected my classes to be very challenging. However, I did not expect to be subjected to unreasonable expectations and poor communication by professors in a professional graduate curriculum like the “weed-out” courses I had during undergrad.\n",

As many mentioned, you can only make a 90% for most assignments without doing Above and Beyond work.  This work isn't impossible, but even then you most likely won't get higher than a 95.  \n\nIf you aren't an amazing programmer, I would highly suggest you start on the projects well before they are due.  Don't procrastinate.  The TA's will not help on the projects in any way.  You will run into issues.  Start early on everything.  Before the midterm project, there is only one assignment that requires any coding at all, so the difficulty jump here is terrible. You need to brush up on your python and numpy skills well before you get to this point.\n\nThe notebook quizzes are terrible.  There is no other way to describe them.  They are only worth a tiny portion of your grade, though, so not too big of a problem.  \n\nThe assignments are pretty fun, but you don't code until about 1/3 of the way in as I mentioned before.  \n\nThe final project is student choice.  I didn't find this project as hard, but I had also gotten used to Numpy by this time.\n\nThe final exam is hard, but you get two chances.  Study and you will get a good grade.\n\nThe slack channel is your friend.  Seriously.  Bookmark this channel.  It is incredibly active and is probably the easiest way to get your questions answered.  One of the TA's is involved there and he is incredibly helpful.  You can also get great ideas for Above and Beyond in this channel.\n\nOverall, I liked this course a lot. I definitely recommend it and can easily be paired with a second course if you have the time.  Just make sure to get ahead on that midterm.   ",

Dr. Joyner is very active, both on the slack channel and the Piazza forums.  He is very helpful and I will take other courses by him.  There is very little TA involvement though.  \n\nAbout the course:\nThere are 10 assignments that are basically reports.  They require around 1600 words per paper.  These are fine and will help you understand the material well.  They can get a bit boring after awhile though.\n\nThere are two projects.  The individual project isn't difficult at all and I felt it was just like another assignment.  The group project was a repeat of 5 of the assignments you had already done, but now in a group.  If you can choose your own group.  My group was fine, but didn't communicate well.  I felt that I did a majority of the work.  \n\nThere are too many readings.  They start off interesting and get worse as you go.  I quit reading them after the midterm because I needed to spend more time in another class.  By doing so, my midterm grade went down 10 points.  This implies to me that they aren't that important.\n\nThe tests are open book.  I found them to be rough.  We got two hours to take them, but I think in the future they will only be 90 minutes.  Anyways, I didn't do the readings for them and still got a good grade, but I used all two hours and they were open book.  If the tests are not two hours in the future, you may want to make sure you do the readings as I always ran out of time when I searched through the readings for the answers to test.\n\nOverall, great class.  Loved it and Dr. Joyner is fantastic.  I highly recommend this class.  It would make a good pairing with a second course.",

Perhaps this is easier for those who had algorithms as an undergrad, you but don't need it to be successful in this class.  \n\nWith the exception of the dynamic programming, homework  only took a couple hours to complete.  However, doing only the assigned problems was not enough for me to do well on the exams, I did most of the problems in the book and others I could find online as well.  For me,  workload was light most weeks,  but spiked just before exams.\n\nI don't think theres a need to prepare in advance.  I came in without a CS undergrad or advance prep and did well.  But if you like to prep, get a head start with the dynamic programming -- I found that the topic that took the longest to master.  ",

The assignments are intense but overall manageable if you start early and use the resources available (I found the slack community the most helpful followed by piazza). The exams are rough. This semester we were given a week to complete a take home exam for the midterm and final. The exams are more open-ended than the assignments and require a lot of time. I think a few things could help students prior to taking the class:\n\n1. Be comfortable with python and numpy\n2. Take a course or two covering related topics prior to this course (ML4T, AI4R, DVA, ML, etc)\n3. Start everything early and ask questions.\n4. Complete any extra credit you can\n\nI felt like this class was definitely worth it for those interested in ML/AI and is probably better earlier in the program.

Compared to my previous OMSCS course (6300), I would say I averaged twice as many hours reading through the (often dense) textbook and studying for exams. The real gem was the project, where we learned everything from designing databases with diagrams and understanding DB concepts (EER, IFD, relations), to implementing them using languages and tools I'd never programmed in before (MySQL, Php, HTML, MAMP). It provided me with not only a working prototype of a database in action, but also with a great experience working with teammates who I plan to keep in contact with. By comparison, the four exams only nominally helped to prepare us for each phase of the project, and seemed much more difficult than initial self-study and sample exams would indicate. I think that pacing in the course could be improved; the beginning felt very rushed to complete everything, whereas by the end it felt like there wasn't enough to keep us busy. It was up to us to plan our learning material consumption, but the deadlines with exams and project phases did not always give ideal time lengths to prepare. Professor Mark and the TAs are knowledgeable and approachable, though if you really want questions answered be prepared to ask during office hours. Overall, it was a challenging course and I liked certain parts more than others, but I definitely learned a lot.",

Even though some of them are shallow, you do get deeper knowledge on the topics used for assignments, e.g. shortest path, A* search, decision trees/random forests, unsupervised learning (clustering), hidden markov model, etc. Some of them are must-knows for tech interviews. Also some very interesting topics like constraint satisfaction and logic planning, which could help you solve a lot of brain teasers:)\n\nI would say AI is about 2-3 times harder than DVA in terms of time spent, depending on your background. If you were like me, a professional developer in the industry for years, you will find it's easy to pick up python/numpy as part of your 1st assignment. But bayes networks, linear algebra and some other math really gave me hard time, so be prepared. \n\nThere're 6 programming assignments about each every 2 weeks, plus two exams each takes one week to finish. This made the schedule really tight and I didn't have too much down time during the semester even just taking this 1 course. So be prepared for a few busy weekends and stay-up-late nights if you work fulltime or/and have kids to take care of. \n\nOveral I loved this course and I think it was a great first course to AI before taking more ML related courses, as long as you're ready for the challenge.",

            "text": "Took this course on my first sem in OMS. It was a useful course to me because I got to learn big data technologies like spark, hadoop, scala etc., - but you could have learned more if you just read a book on each of those subjects as this course does not go deep into each technology.\n\nThere were a lot of difficulties setting up env in the beginning. TAs were kinda responsive, but not very helpful. The homeworks were not structured well at all! I did have plenty of time to complete each homework, but I had no idea whether my code was right or wrong! There was no feedback or guidance on this part. So, for many assignments - students who check their code on few test cases after submission learned that they had missed a minor edge case which was only in the TA's test set and lost marks due to that. IMHO, if you actually want to learn big data technologies, grab a few books with big data tech. names on them and just do the programs in the book. You'll learn a lot more that way.\n\nThe only interesting part of the course was the project (which fortunately was a huge chunk of your final grade). You are allowed to choose from a wide range of pre-selected topics. The project can be done in a group of 3 or solo. You can also get access to datasets which are normally not available for free access online. I would say this was the only useful thing I got out of this course.\n\nI would assume this course is going to be restructured or rebuilt soon because of the complaints that were made during my semester. Overall, if you are not comfortable learning and implementing with 3-4 technologies in a short period of time, you are going to have a hard time. If you want to take this course, pair it with some lighter course and read additional big data material on your own to get the most out of this course.",

            "text": "Background:\nThis is my first course in the OMSCS program and I intentionally took this course for two reasons.  First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks.  Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program.  I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\n\nPros:\n- The head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza.  Two thumbs up here.\n- Each project has enough time to complete.\n- The lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\n- You do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming.  They don't go too deep, but that's mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\n- Two instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\n\nCons:\n- The articles were difficult to read through.  Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\n- The lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\n- I had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN's)\n- Projects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you'll be fine.)\n- Test questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\n- ProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it's worth.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this course.  I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background.  This course uses Python, so you'd benefit from already knowing it, but that's not a necessity.  Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project.  I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat.",

            "text": "This class drove me absolutely insane.\n\nFirst: a huge chunk of the material on the exams were never taught through the lectures or the textbook. I took so much time to understand the lectures and readings. I look forward to seeing how much I know by taking exams in classes, but the exams made me feel like I was wasting my time. Almost every question requires the instructor to post a clarification on Piazza. Some of them even required a Wikipedia link in order to solve since it wasn't in the lectures or textbook. There is so much material to cover in this class, there should be no reason for adding material never taught.\n\nSecond: The assignments take a LONG time to complete. There are 6 of them every 2 weeks. You cannot catch your breath. As soon as you submit the previous assignment, the next one is released and back to work you go for hours upon hours. I do want to add that the assignments helped me learn the material the most.\n\nThird: The TAs take an extremely long time to respond to questions. This is horrible when you have less than two weeks to work on the assignments and you need a clarification.\n\nFourth: The lecture videos by professor Starner are awful and uninformative. The professor has two guest lecturers, Peter N and Sebastian T, and their lectures are way more informative and really good at explaining concepts. Professor Starner just reads from a script and is hard to listen to.\n\nI definitely would not take this class as my first AI class. I would take ML or other AI concepts first so that you know the material going in because when it comes to exams, you will not have been taught the material.",

It is easy to get an A in this class as long as you spend the time. Generally you will be able to keep working/debugging code until you are certain that it is 100% correct. You have 3 weeks per HW assignment, which is reasonable as long as you start working immediately and don't procrastinate on the group project.\n\nMy only gripe about this class is that it should be worth 6 credit hours instead of 3. There is no way that the amount of content covered and work required for this class should be weighted the same as courses like ISYE 6501 and MGT 6754 which generally are in the 5-7 hours/week range.",

            "text": "Was already familiar with many of the algorithms that were covered in lecture. Later strategies were interesting. The projects are a whole other beast as they test much more than what is covered in lecture. Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are 'easier' conceptually but 'significantly less straightforward' to implement.\n\nEg a project which was basically 'implement particle filters' which I've implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that's not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\n\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn't manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It's just due to the all or nothing nature it'll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\n\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don't consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\n\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\n_____\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won't have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won't even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn't even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there's a significantly simpler alternative that's much easier than the suggested algorithm. Save your time for Project 2/3 instead of the miniproject.",

            "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and it really changed my perspective on how to design interfaces.  Dr. Joyner is a fantastic instructor, and this course was one of the best I've taken in the OMSCS program.  \n\nBefore I took this course, I had a vague sense of what made a poor user interface, and this course teaches you the underlying principles of usability and user-centered design.  After the course, I can now analyze and articulate how an interface could be improved based on user-centered design principles.\n\nThe course has two main lesson tracks that were taught in parallel: **Methods** and **Principles**. \n\n **Methods** focuses on the process of conducting HCI research such as understanding regulations about testing with human subjects, performing needfinding (understanding needs of the user), brainstorming approaches, prototyping, and evaluating designs.  All of this is comprises the design lifecycle.  \n\n**Principles** focuses on the design principles in HCI, such as the *Gulf of Execution* (how the user figures out what they want to do and how to do it) and the *Gulf of Evaluation* (did the interface respond how the user expected?).  You also will learn about concepts that improve usability and the limitations of users (human abilities).  This was my favorite portion of the course.\n\n**Assignments:** Weekly assignments were due that usually required 1200-1500 words of writing based on that week's lecture content.  I found these assignments to be easy but useful.  I usually spent 3-4 hours writing each assignment, but the **Methods** assignments required outside work that took a few hours to perform (conducting needfinding with others, developing prototypes, etc). \n\n**Tests:** There are two tests that cover the first half of the course and the second half of the course.  The two tests are open-book and open-note (including Udacity and papers) extremely straightforward (not necessarily easy), but there's no trickery involved or gotcha questions.  Dr. Joyner provided a terrific analysis after the exams to identify problematic questions and other potential test issues.  \n\n**Projects:**\nThere is an individual project and a group project where you go through a round of the design lifecycle by yourself (individual project) and then as a group (group project).  These projects primarily reinforce the material in the **Methods** lectures as you practice what you've learned in them.\n\n**tl;dr:** Excellent course.  Not super difficult.  Very enjoyable.  Great if you want to learn more about designing good UI/UX.",

TAs were not very responsive in Piazza this semester (Spring 2018).  This class is too laissez-faire (in my opinion) and fails to provide effective feedback on assignments.\n\nI had a fair amount of ML experience from previous learning (I had watched the Supervised Learning lectures a year earlier, and taken other AI classes in the past) coming into this course, but this course was still challenging.  \n\nThe lecture quality is pretty good; the professors Isbell and Littman are very knowledgable and their humorous banter in the videos is funny.  I liked the conversational style they used in the videos - it's a dialogue between the teacher (alternates between Charles and Michael) and the other plays an inquisitive student who asks questions.\n\nThe assignments were super open-ended and I felt graded quite harshly given the lack of concrete direction.  There seemed to be a hidden rubric used to grade submissions that was not shared with students in the assignment descriptions.  I felt frustrated with the assignments because I felt like I wasn't really learning much but simply twiddling hyperparameter knobs in order to generate plots for the report.  Further, the feedback that I received from the TAs was usually  weak and non-specific after they'd take off 30 points.  I spent probably 30ish hours on average for the problem sets.\n\nI wish the course offered more structure (\"Students have successfully used this GitHub repo <some_url> for Assignment #1.  Train the model, plot learning curves (accuracy vs. time and accuracy vs. iterations), do tasks X, Y, Z\") rather than giving vague instructions (\"pick some interesting problems and fiddle with the hyperparameters for algorithms A, B, and C.  Plot some stuff and tell us your observations\").  I'd also have appreciated a more specific rubric for what's expected on the assignments - I'd love to go on the intellectual journey, but please tell me the waypoints!\n\nThe exams were hard but fair.\n\nI'm happy to have this course behind me.  There were high points (lecture content is good), but the assignments were simply not helpful for my learning.",

The lecturers (Isbell and Littman) are very engaging but the material itself can be quite dense. And the research papers are tough to get through if you are not used to reading academic CS papers. There are also weekly office hours with the TAs which were very helpful. The TAs were very accessible, hosting office hours and appearing in the Slack group.\n\nThe structure of the class is 2 homework assignments with a week to complete, then a project with 2 weeks to complete, for a total of 6 HW and 3 projects. There was an opportunity for an extra 10 points on one HW assignment. The assignments are released in 3 batches, so you can work ahead to some degree but couldn't finish the semester all at once.\n\nThe homework was challenging conceptually at times but usually did not require much code. I thought all of the homeworks did a good job of reinforcing concepts from the lectures. All 6 assignments were submitted through a web app that gave immediate feedback on your results. Each question on the assignments had a 10 submission limit to prevent brute-forcing solutions.\n\nTwo projects involved reproducing results from research papers, and one involved training an agent for an OpenAI Gym environment, using an algorithm from a research paper(s) of your choice. The deliverable was the code on Github and a 5-page report on your results. \n\nI did not enjoy the projects based on reproducing papers and didn't find the topics very interesting. The OpenAI project was quite interesting but very time-consuming. Training time for the agent could take many hours so iterating on a concept was difficult.\n\nOverall I thought the course was very well done even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was more theory and less practice than I would have liked, but that's a matter of personal preference.",

            "text": "I took this course with Dr. Chau (OMSA). The OMSA course consists of 4 very large assignments and a semester-long group project. I believe this may be the most time-intensive course in the OMSA program, and I recommend either taking it early or as a \"capstone\" class to finish up the program.\n\nThe most challenging part of this course was the amount of time that needed to be put into the assignments and projects. The concepts were arguably quite simple, each assignment required learning one or more new programming languages and/or technologies. Setup of the environments required often took a lot of time too. Dr. Chau was receptive to feedback, and modified the last assignment to have one of the questions be for bonus credit, which helped it be more manageable. It's possible the online course will change dramatically based on the course feedback. That said, it is an incredibly time intensive course and you should plan accordingly.\n\nThe project was... frustrating (to me). The assignments were so time intensive that our team struggled to work on the project early on and ended up pulling things together at the last minute. Another challenge was the difficulty in making group decisions when a group leader wasn't established and the whole team couldn't find time to meet virtually.\n\nI will address the concern about using Azure and AWS with a personal credit card as stated in another review. While, yes, it was annoying and uncomfortable to provide that information, for both services we got much, much more free credit than was needed to complete the assignment, and students who did go over the free limit were able to get the charges waived by calling customer support and explaining the situation. The Azure part of the assignment could be completed on a personal computer and then uploaded to the server, eliminating any chance of error/using up the credit.\n\nI learned so much in this class and was exposed to a large number of data technologies. I know there are some people who struggled greatly with this class, but I found it comparable to (if not easier than) my undergrad engineering courses at a top-ranked engineering school, so the quality was what I expected. I think the class does have room for improvement, and could use more TA support to improve communication and responses to Piazza. All said, I wish I had used this as a capstone class toward the end of my degree and had taken it on its own, so I could have gotten more out of the project.",

            "text": "I took this course during the during my second semester in the program along with CS 6035 IIS. My previous courses were CS 6250 CN and CS 6340 SAT. I had learned the basics of Python in CN but I had not used numpy at all before this course. Additionally, I completed a computer engineering undergraduate degree in 2014 as my only other exposure to computer science before this program. This information is all to compare to your own circumstances.\n\nOverall, this course was by far my favorite while also being the most difficult and most work thus far. Some projects took 10 hours while others took up to 50 hours due to my background. The projects are very diverse so if you've never seen some of these topics until this course, then your learning curve will be longer for each project like mine. The majority of the projects had extra credit that rewards those who know their coding and material. I highly recommend scoring as many points as possible on the projects as the midterm and finals are intense.\n\nBoth exams are take-home exams that are 35-45 pages each with a full week to complete. I spent 40-50 hours on them to achieve a level above the median to make up for my lackluster performance on a project. These exams will thoroughly test your knowledge of each part of the course, which I prefer as you can't fake your knowledge. You are only allowed the class resources and book for these exams. No INTERNET, collaboration and so forth is allowed. The book is a must due to the complexity of the concepts and use for projects and exams.\n\nI highly recommend this course if you have never taken an AI course before as you will learn a ton. However, honestly gauge your knowledge and skills beforehand to see how much of your life you will have to give to be able to succeed. After taking two courses as a full-time student, I do not recommend another course at the same time if you work full-time unless you have expertise in python, numpy, and AI concepts.",

Do you already know what a histogram, scatterplot and boxplot are?  awesome, you can skip most of the first half of the semester.  \n\nI like Dr Joyner, but I think he inherited a bad situation.  Lectures had a few interesting bits, but mostly took a long time to say something pretty straightforward.  Homeworks/projects were tedious and had to be written in R.  Graders deducted points for random things which weren't even in the instructions.  Both of the exams were poorly-written and somewhat ambiguous.  (There were disputes on a significant number of the questions.)  On the plus side, the homeworks and projects were released ahead of time, so at least you could work ahead if your scheduled allowed.",

Highly suggest you get a better computer in order to run the android studio smoothly.

            "text": "##### Overview\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that I went into this course really excited to learn about Machine Learning (with a mild interest in trading), having chosen to specialize in it through OMS CS. Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng's outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\n\n##### What You'll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn't feel like a master's level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\n\n##### Positives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes. Also, because there's no curve, the classroom environment becomes very positive (not competitive) and people genuinely try to help everyone else.",

This class has an excellent ratio of Theory and Practice.\n\nAlso, because of the practical side of this class, I was able to get a job as a Junior Data Scientist!! \nSo, in short, you'll learn R, Data Analysis and Visualization, Intro to ML (Logistic and Linear Regression) and hands-on experience in case you want to look for jobs in Data Science. \n\n That's a 10 in my book, hehe.",

            "text": "I found this course to be very enjoyable in general. The lectures were a bit hit or miss, but the assignments were usually good about guiding you through the problems. I came into the course with some programming experience but only very little exposure to Python, and I thought it was a great introduction to Python including Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. The later assignments focused more on mathematical theory and concepts useful to data analytics such as optimization problems and algorithms, which were very math-y but also very helpful to reinforce my understanding of the workings behind these methods. It helped that there was a refresher on the linear algebra and calculus included as part of the instructional materials.\n\nThe fact that the assignments are autograded with unlimited submissions means you have as much time as you need to test your solutions and get as much credit as you can. The assignments are released well ahead of time so if you need to get a head start and give yourself some time off between assignments that's totally feasible. Some assignments were much easier than others, so I'd say the avg workload was about 4-8 hours per week.\n\nThe exams worked much the same way homework did, open note/internet with no proctoring, but were much longer than the typical homework assignment and with a time limit (both midterms were 24 hrs, the final was 36 hrs). I spent about 5-8 hours with each of the three exams, but I know other students struggled with the amount of time they needed to complete the tests. The professor and TAs were responsive and made some changes to the exam format to help accommodate the students who had issues though, which I appreciated even though it didn't impact me much.\n\nOverall, highly recommended course. As someone who had a programming background, I think it's still worthwhile to take unless you're already very comfortable using Python, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.",

If you don't understand regression and don't know R, I would actually suggest this course as your first course in the program instead of ISYE 6501.  Prof Serban does a nice job taking you through examples in R line by line to help you understand what you are doing.  The biggest weakness of this course is the general organizational stuff.  There were tons of typos in the homeworks and due dates seemed to shift.  The course could also do with a pass through the video transcription to better match the video.  Prof Serban, in the couple of instances I interacted with her, was generally flexible and accommodating of issues and feedback from students.  My only other complaint is that I would have liked to spend more time working with the models talked about in unit six (non linear regression, non parametric regression, etc)  The class focuses on Linear Regresssion, ANOVA, Logistic Regression, Poisson Regression and Variable Selection.

            "text": "I absolutely loved this course, and I'm very glad I chose it for my first semester. Dr. Sokol's lectures were engaging, informative, and clearly understandable. I don't know if there's much he could have done better with the lectures, they were that good. Even when he was working through formulae and variables, I was still able to follow along most of the time, and if I wasn't, just a couple repeat viewings and I was on the same page. The course surveys countless topics at a rapid speed, but I never felt like it was moving too fast. I'm amazed at how much I know now compared to the start of the semester.\n\nHomeworks mostly use R for building and evaluating models. I'd had no experience with R before starting the course, so the early going was a bit rough, but once I got up to speed I was much more comfortable. The assignments are designed to set you on your own path of discovery and learning, and I found that I benefited the most from them when I approached them that way. On the weeks where I was more time-constrained or felt a bit lost in R, I found the TA office hours sessions to be very helpful. I never attended one live, I only ever watched video recordings. I did my best not to carbon copy everything the TAs had done, because they basically provided you with the answers most of the time - even something as simple as changing the names of variables helped me internalize the solution better than copying everything to the letter. \n\nPeer reviewing has pros and cons, the biggest pro is that I saw a few really impressive submissions that actually taught me a thing or two (especially when people took the time to create Jupyter notebooks out of their submissions) but the worst con was reviewing some of the poorer submissions or the ones that just lifted the answers from the TA office hours with no elaboration. So depending on the luck of the draw you could find the peer review process to be educational or not. Also, feedback from other students was very inconsistent, sometimes you'd get great suggestions about how you could have done things differently, but most of the time it seems I got no feedback at all or something brief like \"good job\" with no detail. \n\nExams were very fair, and I didn't mind the proctoring as much as I thought I would (but I'm also not a parent so a quiet, private session was easy for me to manage). Exam questions usually required you to think through every answer and choose carefully, and I thought they did a good job testing my understanding of the material.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this course highly enough, and I strongly suggest taking it in your first semester as an OMSA student if you can.

The video are well done but many of them are just walkthroughs of your homework assignment that week.  The exams are insane.  For the two mid terms you are given 24 hours to complete the exam.  However, unless you are a very experienced programmer, you can expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours of work to complete each mid term (based on the results of slack polls).    Again, if you are python pro, you'll finish the exams in like 6 hours, but if you're not, plan on clearing your schedule for 24 hours because you will most likely need the time.  The mid term was also like this although we were given 36 hours to complete the exam instead of 24.  An improvement to be sure but still a very stressful and intense 36 hours.  To give some perspective, someone pointed out in Slack, 18 hours is the length of the California Bar Exam administered over 3 days.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that you'll spend that much time on each exams over one 24 hours period.     ",

However, this class uses R so take that for what it's worth.\n\nLectures: Lectures are well organized, sufficient material to have a clear understanding of the topic but not so much that you begin to zone out and lose interest. When studying for the final, I was able to review and watch all lectures within a few hours (2x speed).\n\nHomework: Like many reviews, I will agree that the homework assignments can be disproportionate in terms of overall grade weight and time input, especially if you're like me with very little R programming experience coming into the class. Still, good practice utilizing the concepts learned in lectures. Peer grading can be very inconsistent, but generally forgiving overall.\n\nProject: No coding, open ended. The opposite of HW. Equal to over half of HW grade weight but equal to the amount of work for a single HW. Some adjustments could be made between the two.\n\nQuizzes (midterms): These can be pretty tricky so you really have to have a solid understanding of the material. An item that was only mentioned for a few seconds on a single slide could be a question on any quiz. A \"cheat sheet\" is allowed for all quizzes but I rarely used them. I believe they were a teaching mechanism to re-enforce learning more than they were as a reference on a quiz.\n\nProfessor/TAs: Solid. Dr. Sokol's personality really shows in the lectures and he clearly enjoys the material which also gets the student naturally engaged in learning. The TAs were very responsive in Piazza/office hours and also the slack group for the class so you never felt like you were on an island.\n\nTip: Join the slack group\n\nOverall, excellent course.",

TA's weekly office hour was very very helpful to clarify confusions in a homework. Few troll in peers can give you a low grade without any comment, which is frustrating. But, most of reviews I got was reasonable and helped me to improve. If they don't change the system in the next semester, your assignments will be reviewed by three different randomly chosen peers and assigned grade will be a median of the three grades.\n\nExams were fair. There were few tricky questions that require some thinking. What I liked the most for the exams was that it was designed to test your understanding on the models, not memorization. \n\nOverall it is very good class and I've learned a lot through this class.

Like the Fall 2017 semester, Professor Joyner once again joined the instructor team to help ensure things ran more or less smoothly. And by \"help\", I mean he appeared to be \"the\" instructor for the course (despite what the course sign-up states, Professor Chakraborty was not involved in anything student-facing). Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it's a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\n\nContent-wise, the first half of the course's lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon's explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It's like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\n\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\n\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you're not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there's no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that's 105%, you've got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range. There didn't seem to be many issues with grading as long as you followed the requirements.\n\nCommunication-wise is where things could have been better. The TAs were great for office hours on Slack and generally responsive on Piazza, but private posts would get ignored and it seemed like there were some topics the TAs didn't want to get involved with.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good class if you're interested in R, but the lectures were often awkward to watch and the algebra portions didn't really add much to the course in any meaningful way.",

This was the only course I took this semester and I struggled to keep up with the amount of practice and preparation that was required. \n\nIf you are reading this review and hoping to prepare for the class, study DP, NP Reductions and Max-Flow as well as Min-Cut. These are the main topics you will be tested on. There are graph algorithms as well, but you will never be asked to find a shortest path or anything like that, you will need to know how the algorithm works and based on the problem presented you will need to identify whether or not the algorithm can be used to solve the problem.\n\nThe lectures in my opinion are only good if you read the book first, then watch them once as you take notes and then watch them again just for content. So in other words they are not as good as other OMSCS courses. If you plan on grasping the material just by looking at the lectures, you probably won't because the lectures go quite fast and they only explain the basics of how to do the problems. A lot of times I also found myself going on YouTube to try to look at different explanations because I thought the explanations given were either not clear or just not good enough. \n\nI suggest taking this course on its own and if you have a few classes left, perhaps a semester before you graduate so you can re-take it if you do not get a B. \n\nI would also suggest to become a regular on Piazza and do all the homeworks even though they are not worth many points. Basically, if you know how to do the homework, you will have the needed knowledge to pass the test. ",

I liked DVA, but I thought this course was much better - I loved it. \n\n**Positives**:\n\nDr Thrun's lectures are fascinating, and he has boundless enthusiasm for the subject. That enthusiasm didn't just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\n\nDr Summet's office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions. \n\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn't cover *that* many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you'll feel proud. And if you're like me,  you'll replay the Python scripts over and over once you're done just to watch what you made.\n\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive. \n\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You'll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\n\n**Negatives**\n\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you'll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don't underestimate the time commitment you'll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get *any* points on their test runs before having to turn it in. \n\n**Tips**\n\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you're already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements. \n\nI wouldn't go so far to say that the lectures didn't cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned. You'll have to get creative.",

            "text": "I took this course with very little C programming experience.  The first project had a significant learning curve for me in all aspects.  The first two projects were 60+ hr  of work each for me.  I did well on the third because it was easier and also am more comfortable C.  I'm guessing a student with a C programming background could complete the projects in a quarter the time I spent.  It did take significant effort up front to understand the requirements of the projects.  You can do this class without C in you skillset, but you will spend 10+ hours a week the first half of the course catching up on it because the projects require it.  Working full time, tackling this course material, teaching myself C, and another class on top of that was not the best idea.  \n\nThe professor, TAs, and Piazza/slack community were great in getting assistance with the projects and answering questions. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are well presented and organized.  Due to my efforts catching up on C and taking another class, I did not get to dive into the material as much as I would have liked.  One thing that I wish the class provided was more assignments related to the readings.  Whether essay or simple quizzes, I think it would help students take more from this material to have it tested in more than just the two exams.  Only half the readings relate at all to the projects.  No textbook required, but you should have some OS programming reference material handy.\n\nOverall very worthwhile course but A LOT of work if you don't know C!\n\nsemi-pro tip: Set up and get comfortable with an IDE ( I used VS code, many used CLion) the first week or prior to taking the class.  You will need it!",

The course assignments are in R, but it's not too difficult because R code is always provided and well explained with the lectures; you then adapt this code for the 5 homework assignments, the 2 midterms and the final. \n\nThe problem with this course is that sometimes communication is not clear, multiple choice questions are not well formulated, and there are errors in homework (exercises and solutions). Course staff made an effort to accommodate complaints. But I hope that the course material will be improved for future courses. I took this course in Spring 2018, but think it's doable in the shorter Summer term if you count approximately 12 hours per week .  ",

I don’t have a programming background, so although I had taken GT’s Python Introduction (1301) and Introduction to Modelling (6501) before, this course was a challenge. I spent an average of 15 hours per week over the 15 week period on this course (including time spent on the exams, which is significant). Grading is very straightforward, with a graded homework assignment almost every week (13 in total); these count for 3-4% each, or 50% in total. The homeworks are beginner friendly, because you have an unlimited number of submissions. Midterm 1 counts 10%, Midterm 2 15%, and 25% for the Final. This term MT2 was the most challenging of all. They gave us a 24h window for MT1 and MT2, and even 36 hours for the Final; if you are a slow coder, you will use most of these time windows. After some negative feedback for MT2, my impression was that the Final was slightly easier. \n\nSo this course was hard, but I had a tremendous learning curve, I am amazed by all the stuff I know how to do with Python now, and I feel well prepared for the coming CS classes in this programme. I'm sad it's over!    ",

And it’s what interviewers ask about.\n\n- Lectures are very clear and indepth. Didn’t need the book. Also any prereqs are covered in the lectures, except for graph theory. If you’re dying to prep before the course starts, maybe Graph Theory and BFS.Dijkstra are a good idea. Other than that I don;t see a reason to start early. Go into this class with a clear mind cause you’re gonna think and study A LOT.\n- Exams are fair. Not easy, and not impossible. Just the right balance to test how well you understand the material, and can apply it to new problems.\n- AWESOME staff. Professor is very active on Piazza, he is a true educator that cares about his students. Same with TAs who held 3 office hours per weekto answer HW questions, and any otherproblems from the book...etc.\n- HWs, althoughof very low weight are extremely important. As well as practicing on your own with extra problems from the book or anywhere else. Practice is key here. You gotta train your brain on these kinds of problems. Don’t be disappointed if you can’t solve any of the Dynamic Programming problems. Just make sure you practice enough, and you’ll be fine.\n- There was a coding project. It was very easy and not much of a learning opportunity. There’s room for improvement here.\n- 3 midterms and a final. Midterms are not cumulative, so you can dive deep and practice specific topics as much as you want.\n- This class is a marathon run. There a re no dull moments. Every week you’ll either be busy working on a HW or prepping for an exam. That’s why try not to burn yourself by prepping too much before the semester starts.\n\nBottom line. This is the best run class in OMSCS. And one of the most important to take. Can’t believe there’s a specialization (Interactive Intelligence) that doesn’t mandate this course.",

In my case, CV provided the background to make CP only medium difficulty.\n\nTips to get an A: \n1. Always try for A&B: The above and beyond grading scheme on the assignments is a strange beast. On one hand, you have absolutely no clue how to get that final 10% of your grade. On the other hand, it encourages you to just try something -  just use your wild imagination and creativity - and you are rewarded by the fair and generous grading.\n\n2. The assignments, projects and exams get progressively harder and trickier towards the end of the course, so work hard at the beginning and don't procrastinate.\n3. You're generally graded on the quality of the report and not the code, so have fun coding and all, but to get full marks, make sure you answer all the questions and follow all the guidelines in the report. In fact, if your code fails or you run out of time, you can still get a good grade by describing what you did and didn't do.",

            "text": "There are a couple of things going into this class that made it easy for myself personally, namely some stats background and some coding background. Overall, the course was very descriptive when it came to forcing the understanding of the few types of regression models discussed in the class. After taking this class, the takeaways should be the model code and the interpretation of the models both in a statistical way and in layman's terms. The course material itself is quite straightforward, plug-and-play in just about every way and requires more regurgitation skill rather than critical thinking (making the exam open book made the course disgustingly easy).\n\nThere are no surprises in this class - everything on the exam will have been discussed in enough detail in either the lecture videos or homework. If the question was ambiguous or flat-out wrong, the professor would personally review and clarify, even refunding lost points. \n\n5 homework assignments, each having a multiple choice section for a small portion of the grade and then a couple of self/peer reviewed sections having to do with the data analysis. Each one had a few weeks' worth of time to complete, so the timing was quite reasonable unless you procrastinated. 3 exams with the same format as the homework, just spanning additional subjects and 2.5 hours to complete. All reasonable, unless you had a bug in your code.\n\nOnly two drawbacks in this class - the material is incredibly dry and repetitive. There are 15 minute lectures for what could be explained at a high level in 3, but get drawn out and watched regardless (easily half of the week's workload would be taking notes). The key takeaways will be identified in the lecture through boxes (hard copies of the powerpoints screw with physical note-takers like myself, though).\n\nThe second drawback is the lack of statistical discipline by the professor at times. There has been some confusion when the professor uses terms that are not correct in a statistical sense (goodness-of-fit vs. predicting power) early in the course that screwed with lectures later in the course. During this semester, a couple of the videos could have been re-recorded due to some mistakes (I expect this to improve over the course of multiple iterations).\n\nAgain, overall a good course to learn a few powerful, easy-to-understand models and a fairly reasonable class in terms of workload to pair with a perhaps more workload intensive class.",

I was surprised how poorly and lazily administered the class was. Regularly the students had to remind the instructors to open the quizzes or post projects based on the schedule. The textbook is a must only because the quiz questions are verbatim from the book. The exams, which are a major part of the grade, had very little quality control and were very unbalanced (neglecting several topics but focusing too many questions on a single topic). The only redeeming part is the projects, which are pretty interesting. But for a CS newbie, it required more time than it should have. Also, be prepared to think about breaking things rather than building. That was the challenge for me. Previous classes (CN, DBS, GIOS)",

While its primary focus was more on the underlying mechanism of commonly-used packages in python, the course was nonetheless effective when getting students to think about what was required to succeed in the space.\n\nAs stated before, during the Spring 2018 semester there was a massive disconnect between the homework assignments and the exams. There were three exams, all of which were open-source barring collaboration with people (but open-google, short of posting your ask on stackoverflow). However, the exams consisted basically of 6 homework assignments for you to complete in as much detail as possible. Exam 1 (24 hour max) was quite reasonable as the first few homeworks were very easy and were more on the programming, but Exams 2 (24 hour max) and 3 (36 hour max) ended up being harder variants of the homework problems to be done in a shorter period of time. I still aced the class, but the exams were definitely marathons (Exam 1: 4-6 hours, Exam 2: 18 hours, Exam 3: 10 hours, but only did enough to get 80% since I'd already guaranteed my A). Future iterations of this course will probably see updated exam logistics.\n\nNonetheless, nobody said it would be easy, and all things considered it was a deep enough course to justify an intro to programming for data science at the graduate level. For this student at least, a lot was learned. \n\nBackground: Proficient in coding in other languages such as MATLAB, SQL, some other object oriented programming languages, took Regression/6501 prior to or during this course, strong calculus/linear algebra/diff eq background from engineering days.",

The course material is excellent and well-organized and the projects do a good job of reinforcing the material.  For example, we implemented MPI collectives using only send and receive operations in one lab, so that you really understood what they did before you started using them as black boxes.\n\nGetting a correct implementation of an algorithm (which isn't trivial) will get you 80 to 90 percent of the project points usually and then it takes some significant fine-tuning and experimentation to get the rest.  The test are very hard, but the problems are well-stated, unlike some other classes where the tests are hard because of ambiguity.  The TAs give generous partial credit and the Prof Vuduc gives a generous curve on top of that.  Note, however, that you're being curved against some very smart classmates due HPC's reputation as a difficult class, the fact it's not required for any specialization, and the substantial drop rate.  I would strongly recommend taking CCA or GA before this class and you need to be decent with C (taking GIOS would certainly be enough prep).",

First, the material is difficult to learn and takes some time to fully understand. The book and lectures do a terrible job of explaining the material (the book is vague and the lectures focus primarily on mathematically proving the theorems behind the material rather than the testable material itself).    \n\nThe second part of the challenge in this course is the way the exams and homework are graded. The rubric calls on strict adherence to very specific terminology, formatting, and nitpicks minor details. This can be frustrating because even with a mastery of the material and after solving difficult questions, you may receive a substantial markdown for trivial \"omissions\" in your solution.\n\nAs you go through this course, I would encourage you to stick with it even if you're receiving poor grades. I did very poorly on the first two exams and still managed to pull through. The very first test is the trickiest... it gets a little bit easier after that. Grades are curved pretty significantly too. Worst case, at least you'll get to see all of the material before taking the class a second time, so you'll be better prepared the next round.\n\nKeys to success:    \n-Take this class by itself, it's really tough    \n-Practice problems from the text book and homework on a whiteboard or on paper over and over again.     \n-If you have time before the course starts, brush up on Dynamic Programming (DP)... it is the most heavily weighted topic that takes the most time to master.    \n-In regards to DP:  focus your efforts on variations of LIS, LCS, and Knapsack type problems... there's no need to get more complicated than that    \n-Pay very close attention to the details of the professor's solutions (such as HW solutions) and make your solutions follow his particular format and verbiage    \n-Don't blow off the project: it's free points... it only takes a couple days to tackle & it'll be in python most likely.    \n-Youtube videos with graphical depictions of the algorithms in action really help\n\nI wish you the very best of luck!!",

            "text": "I believe the difficulty of this class is very much related to your preparedness. I generally enjoy math and also took an algos class on Coursera a couple years ago, and I thought the course was highly enjoyable and not too difficult. If you are in a similar boat, you probably won't have much trouble with this course. On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to algorithms, I would highly recommend priming yourself for this course by taking a free algos class first, or you may find this course to be a lot of work.\n\nAnother key to this class is simply to practice a lot. A lot of the homeworks and exams come down to figuring out ways to apply the algos to a novel problem, sort of like puzzles where the algos are the tools you have to work with. Once you are in this mindset, though, it's pretty fun thinking of ways to solve the problems.\n\nOne last note about this course is that the instructional staff is excellent. Compared to other courses I've taken, Dr. Vigoda is much more active on Piazza. Probably the second-most instructor participation of any course after SDP. Dr. Vigoda was very occasionally a bit snippy here and there, but I'd rather have massive presence with occasional errors than a total lack of presence which seems to be the norm (or at least the median) for OMSCS courses. There were also several TAs that were also active and helpful, more than any other class I've taken. Grading for all homeworks and exams took less than one week (though the project took over a month) which is critically important from a pedagogical standpoint, yet virtually unheard of in this program, so major kudos to the staff in this regards.",

            "text": "This was my first class in the program. While it wasn't a subject I was initially interested in, I learned a lot and had a good experience. The lectures were very clear and well paced. The exams were very much in the spirit of the lectures and were not difficult, although you should study for about week in preparation.\n\nAdditionally, the main TA, Nolan, was incredible. He was very attentive, caring, quick to respond and knowledgable. I was surprised by the amount of collaboration and camaraderie among the class. The other TAs were almost inactive (as far as I could tell. May have done things behind the scenes), however, Nolan was so good it didn't matter.\n\nThe only thing that could be improved were the projects. Each project was essentially running a simulated processor with a test program, tweaking the inputs of the processor, and seeing how it performed differently. Then, there would be a code section were you alter the code of the processor and see how it performs.\n\nThe first section taught me a lot about processors, however, the code portion was more tedious than informative. This is because the simulator is a huge C++ code base that is somewhat poorly written. Most of the time involved in the projects is trying to understand what the code is currently doing. The feedback loop is also very long because running the simulation normally takes about 30 minutes real time.\n\nThe saving grace here is that the TAs allow you to compare results on _a simulation other than the one for the project_. So you can know for sure if you have the right answer.\n\nThis could all be mitigated if the instructions gave you more direct guidance. \"Edit function, foo, so that it does x instead of y.\"\n\nOverall, though, good class, great TA(s).",

I have to admit this was the first time I struggled in a course, and have been very mixed on what to write. If you have any significant milestones in life or at work during the semester you intend to take this course, then I don't recommend this class to you. If you are have a lot of free time available then proceed.\n\nIt was definitely the most difficult course I have ever taken. I did think the material was very useful, and came out better for having made it through. The assignments were pretty cool, and required a significant time to complete. Only complaint was that it was never clear what made the best/fastest approach. It would have been nice to see what others did to get better performance.\n\nThe exams were absolutely insane, and not in a good way. Like other reviews said it is about taking what you learned to the next level. Given an entire weekend you might be able to solve all problems given, but in two hours just try to maximize the points you can get. The only real saving grace to the exams are a significant curve.

The final project (MapReduce) took me about twice as long as the first project.

            "text": "### tl;dr\nChallenging & fun course. Great material. Course management: not great but not terrible.\n\n### Overall\nThis was my first semester in OMSCS. And my first college course in 20 or so years. I found the lectures pretty engaging overall. I had no experience with CV, no linear algebra since HS, limited experience with Python, numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, so I learned a lot in this course. The problem sets were challenging. The specifications could have been clearer. I really struggled with the second problem set and wondered if I was cut out for the class. Then I discovered the Slack channel. Saved my life. Seeing how others approached the problem sets (and how they interpreted the sometimes vague, sometimes incorrect assignments) helped me not get too far into the weeds.\n\n### Problem sets\nA lot of the problem sets, at the heart of it, were translating formulas (and occasional algorithm flowcharts) to Python. Sometimes I understood the fundamentals, sometimes it was straight up transcription.\n\n### Course Management & Piazza\nPiazza was pretty much a dumpster fire. Hard to believe anyone would choose it as a tool. TAs were occasionally helpful, often terse. Lots of questions went unanswered. Trying to navigate Piazza made it not worth trying to get help. Prof. Essa was in absentia until the very end when people got upset. He was also disingenuous by suggesting he told TAs not to reply so students would help each other out. I'd have believed that if it wasn't offered as a *post-hoc* excuse. \n\n### Final project\nThe final project (I chose the CNN one) was very challenging. I learned a crap ton, even though my results were pretty much worthless. I thought I might have tanked it but ended up getting 100%. Probably because I documented it well in the paper. And because I did a lot of research up front and tried to base my approach on current research.\n\n### Exam\nExam was challenging but not terrible. Open book. Which was helpful. I spent a good half-day reviewing the lecture transcripts (helpfully put together by a fellow Slacker) and the lecture slides. Lots of `ctrl-f` of course. Managed to eke out a B on the final and a high B for the course. That included slacking for a week of vacation and getting a 61% on one of the problem sets.\n\n### Advice\n1. Make sure your linear algebra and calculus fundamentals are strong. It will help you truly understand the material.\n1. Make sure you have a pretty solid basis for numpy, especially how slicing and reshaping and such works. Lean on numpy vs. for loops.\n1. Spend a few hours at the start of the course getting a high level view of the history and current topics in CV.\n\n*note: my workload is based on actual measurements. I spent 171 hours on this course total including administrative work like registration, watching lectures, reading research papers, problem sets, peer review, final project, exam, time on Slack*",

            "text": "A few disclaimers: first, I took this class concurrently with KBAI, and this was my first semester in the OMSCS program so my view on the class has very little reference to other classes in the program; second, I did receive an 'A' in the course, so I'll try to not let that color my opinion of it; finally, reading past reviews indicates to me that this class has undergone a fairly large transformation in the past two semesters, be careful making expectations about the course from older reviews.\n\nNow for the review: \nOverall, the course was interesting and fun, and I feel I learned quite a bit. However, there were a few things that bothered me while I was taking the course, and I wanted to wait until it was 100% over to write them up to give others a fair warning about these aspects of the course:\n\nFirst, the open-note final exam did not feel like a good test of the things I had learned watching the lectures and doing the assignments throughout the semester. Another reviewer mentioned it felt like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", but I wanted to expand on this further. Some of the material on the exam did not come from any of the class material.   Most of the exam required finding keywords in PDFs, or a specific sentence mentioned in a lecture. Many of the questions relied on wordplay to attempt to fool the test taker (similar to the lab notebooks).\n\nSecond, the midterm, which I believe was indeed a fair assessment, should have included the grading rubric when it was released. A number of students wasted a lot of time on a portion of it that ultimately was worth much less than the other portions of the exam. Ultimately I believe this contributed to that assessment being the lowest grade overall for the class project-wise. \n\nThird, it appears reviews of the Above and Beyond portion of the assignments were mixed. You really need to attempt to do all of these if you want an 'A' in the course. Personally, I was not really a fan. I thought that while the Above and Beyond sections could produce very excellent work, grading of the sections was too subjective. These Above and Beyond sections count for about 4% of your overall grade, and getting more than half of these points seemed almost unfeasible sometimes. I understand the intention to make the course more fun and produce original pieces of work, but I think more guidelines need to be set for both the students and the graders about what qualifies as an appropriate Above and Beyond. \n\nI do not mean to dissuade others from taking this class. I really did enjoy it (doing the final project and seeing others' results was AMAZING, and all of the assignments were very well-made and fun to do). The TA's were extremely knowledgeable, active and helpful. And I've never felt so much pride in the work I've done for a class. Mostly, I just wanted to make the above writeup as a refresher to the reviews from previous semesters.\n\nP.S. Buy a tripod for your phone, and start the midterm early.",

In numerous cases, the unit tests provided in the assignment passed only then to find that the same code failed on Bonnie. \n\nSo if you assumed you were good because supplied unit tests passed that would be a dangerous assumption, especially as you get toward the assignment submit date. What then makes matters worse is that when Bonnie fails a test the feedback is virtually useless in terms of knowing what is wrong. This is not to say that students should write additional unit tests - what I'm saying is that the unit tests provided in the assignment were dangerous in that they generated a false sense of confidence. \n\nSo overall a course that covers a lot of interesting content but as others have said there was too many topics covered in the course and it could be split into smaller courses. This would provide the ability for students to learn the material more thoroughly. \n\nThe TA support was mediocre. I realize that TA's have their own projects which take their time but when a student takes time to ask a well thought out question, replies from TA's like 'yes' and 'no' don't really cut it. That is if the overriding goal of OMSCS is to spread learning and knowledge about all these new topics.\n\n\n",

            "text": "Big disconnect between video lessons, reading discussions and assignments. Probably, in part, due to the fact the professor changed from the the time the video content was created.  I thought a disproportional emphasis was put into UML versus SW architecture and design topics. Group project towards the end of the semester is interesting, but if you find yourself in a bad team you may be in trouble as the team project accounts for 20% of your entire grade. Also on grading, it took the teaching body a long time to grade assignments, which can be a problem as, since some of the assignments sort of build on each other, if you make mistakes on an early assignment, you may get penalized for the same mistake on a later assignment. However, grading seemed very reasonable and methodical overall. It was my first course on the program, and one I thought to be a good intro to it after the fact. Probably worth taking it, but don't expect much learning if you work as a SW engineer on your day job; however, as others already alluded to, it is a Graduate course and you get what you put in. ",

            "text": "This review is for the OMSCS version taught by Dr. Joyner. \n\nIt seems from some of the reviews on here and comments on Piazza, that this class is very polarizing. Either you seem to hate it or love it. I personally hated it. It's my first OMSCS course, so I have little to compare it to. \n\n<b>Pros:</b>\n<ul><li>The class is extremely easy. The first quarter of the class is basically an introduction to R and an overview of the difference between scatter-plots and box-plots. If you can't pull an A, or at least a B, a master's program may not be right for you at this time. </li>\n<li>Dr. Joyner does seem to care about his students and this program. While he seemed overwhelmed at times, you could tell that he cared and wanted everyone to succeed. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Cons: </b>\n<ul><li> The homework/assignments/exams are poorly written. This is especially true for both the midterm and final exam, which had quite a few questions that could have multiple answers depending on the interpretation of what was actually being asked. A few students started a mini Piazza \"revolt\" where they threatened to escalate issues with the class/midterm if their grievances weren't answered (ironically, they then learned that the person to escalate these issues to for OMSCS is Dr. Joyner).    </li>\n<li> There are a lot of helpful TAs, but they never seemed to be on the same page. There were multiple instances where I would get two very different answers to the same question from different TAs. For example, multiple TAs said on Piazza and Slack that homework had to be done in LaTeX to receive credit. However, when they posted \"exemplary homeworks\" one student had literally hand written his homework, taken pictures with his phone, and cut/pasted the images into a word document.</li>\n<li> The lectures are hilariously bad. It's like they were made in some dystopian future where everyone must speak in a monotone voice and ideas can only be expressed through Word 2010 clip art. More importantly, some of the required readings have massive errors. I was pretty disappointed that this course has been going on for multiple years, and this hasn't been fixed. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out Dr. Lebanon's logistic regression proof, only to realize (about two hours in) that it's just wrong. </li></ul>\n\nOverall, if you want an easy A or want to learn R, take this class.

            "text": "<b>OVERVIEW</b>\n\nEssentially, the course serves as an introduction to Machine Learning, Technical Analysis for Trading, and Python (including Pandas and Numpy). If you're new to ML, Technical Analysis, or Python, this is an excellent first course. While the material effectively covers material sufficient for an introduction, you are free to take your learning further. For example, when learning about Reinforcement Learning, you can simply watch the course videos, or you can supplement your learning by reading the relevant sections from Suttons' book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and the videos from the OMSCS Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning courses. The approach you take, combined with the skills you begin with, will determine how much time you spend on the course.\n\n<b>PROJECTS AND EXAMS</b>\n\nThe projects build upon one another, so if you get something wrong it is critical that you go back and fix it. Also, beginning projects early is extremely useful, because some projects require experimentations and papers. I was surprised at how a few students would appear on Piazza or Slack a few days before the project was due proclaiming that they had not started the assignment and was asking how long it would take to complete. Again, the approach you take will determine how much you get from the class.\n\n<b>ENGAGEMENT</b>\n\nI found the unofficial Slack community the most active - 24/7, especially in the days leading up to a project's due date or an exam. In many cases, students would answer questions in minutes or hours. Piazza was also useful, where some TAs were very active. Although, unlike Slack, answers from TAs or the professor ranged from minutes to days. I found my TA quite good and he would pull in other TAs when he couldn't provide a definitive answer. The professor was active on Piazza for the first half of the course, but was sparsely present during the second. Fortunately, the course proceeded smoothly with the head TA (who has previously taught the course) and other TAs actively participating.\n\n<b>TIPS</b>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Begin projects early</li>\n<li>Read a few research papers so that you can write your reports in a similar style</li>\n<li>View the course as an introduction and feel free to go as deep as your interest takes you</li>\n</ol>",

            "text": "Personal background: This is my first semester and I paired with course with Computer Vision. I don't have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\n\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive. \n\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\n\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended.  So I \"had to\" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\n\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n\n1) you need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me. \n\n2) read and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even 'typing' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called \"Rubberduck debugging\".\n\nFirst class?\nIf you know python and know how to plan to \"solve a problem\" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine. For me, most of the difficulties of Project 3 in the first two weeks came from my messed up code and code structure, which made it very difficult to debug.",

It covers to a decent depth all the 3 learning techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning). The video lectures are very informal & at times highly entertaining. But one needs to be very attentive (& make good notes) since a lot of the questions from midterm & finals are based on the conversations between Prof. Isbell & Prof. Littman. The TA's are engaged and hold regular office hours. Prof Isbell is very active on Piazza & show tremendous patience to the almost repetitive & very annoying questions (some of them seem to simply not use the search feature before posting questions - this can be really painful for a large class like ML). The 4 assignments are meant to let the students do a detailed analysis based on the application of learning techniques, tuning hyper parameters etc on different datasets (of our choosing) & provide right justifications for all our choices. The feedback can be at times very detailed & some times not so thorough(depends on individual grading TA). It can be subjective but most of the time based on well defined rubric. Your analysis can be as independent & informal but cover what's expected. I managed to score pretty high on these (overall above 90%) with a couple of centuries. And this saved me some grace from what was nothing but disaster of a midterm...\nProf. Isbell makes it very clear(repeatedly) that he cares the least when it comes to code for all the analysis & the only thing that matters is good analysis. You can re-use existing code (cite references).\nThe exams are closed book, without any pen/paper etc and expects short concise answers. The idea is to test the understanding of the concepts on many of the topics covered in lectures.\nOverall a fantastic class & personally didn't find it as hard as advertised in discussion forums. ",

            "text": "This course never claims to be similar to Stanford CS231n. It mostly teaches traditional (real) computer vision with machine learning element in some topics. (So I was a bit surprised that now it is a course of ML specialization). Personally I like this aspect more. There are a lot of smart ideas which inspire my ways of thinking. \n\nLinear algebra (a rough idea about what's happening) and numpy skills (vectorized operation) will help you with this course. And Be patient.\n\nRegarding the comment below that \"He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions\", I think the professor means(and he did say) that he encourages discussions instead of feeding you answers directly. My observation is that if I ask \"will I be punished if I use this function in my assignment\", TA will answer it very fast. But if I ask \"is algorithm A/parameter A better than algorithm B/parameter B for this assignment/project\", usually I will not get an answer from the TAs directly (but usually this issue has been discussed somewhere else in the post). I understand it might be a pain if you are rushing to a deadline but I think it's fair for effective learning. I learnt a lot by discussing problems with other classmates. But of course it would be better if TA/professor can give some conclusion remarks on some of the discussions. \n\nOverall after taking the course I respect computer vision more as a science.  I am glad the course is not designed to be an opencv or tensorflow tutorial.",

I tried to take this course over a year ago and ended up dropping it because I could not keep up.  This time around I prepared a couple months in advance by reading through Learn C the hard way and completing all of the C courses on Lynda.  \n\nUse the class Slack channel.  The TA's for this class are amazing and will always help you.  They don't give you answers but they can point you down the right path.  We had other students in the class with experience in some of the areas and they helped out in Piazza and in the Slack channel as well. Between the projects, TA's, and other students, there is a huge wealth of knowledge to gain in this class.  Then add on the papers and lectures and its almost too much.  \n\nThe TA's were very active on Piazza as well.  The instructor held weekly office hours to answer any questions about the projects, lectures, papers, or tests.\n\nProject 1 is really not that bad if you keep it simple, which is harder then it sounds when you're new to this subject.  Its easy to over think the problem and create a mess but the project is really pretty straight forward.  One of the main focuses of the project is multi threading.\n\nProject 2 was extra credit for us.  It had no programming but was a written assignment to design an experiment.\n\nProject 3 was the toughest.  It was a bit more free form in that you could design your program to work many different ways.  Its best to plan this project out before you start programming it.  I jumped right into programming and that was a mistake.  I still did very well on the project but I could have saved myself many hours if i would have designed before programming.  Shared memory and multi threading are some focuses here.\n\nProject 4 was the easiest.  Again its really straight forward but I can see it being another project that is easy to over think and make difficult for yourself.  This one dealt with RPC and multi threading.\n\nI found the mid term and final to be the most difficult part of the class.  You have to read all of the papers and watch all of the lectures and really understand the material in order to do well on the exams.  \n\nI stayed within the class average for the mid term and did very very bad on the final.  I got almost a 100 percent on the all the projects and did the extra credit.  Walked away with a B in the class.\n\nMy background is 1 year as system tech, 3 years of COBOL on a mainframe and almost 2 years now in Java doing full stack.",

First, it takes a long time to understand how to implement them. Then you have to test them, which being machine learning, also takes a long time. Then once you know they work, you need to run them for long periods of time to get the results you need for the analysis. Please don't wait. The analysis isn't bad for each project (only 5 pages each) but obviously you want your code to work properly first. I hate the fact that they didn't release them all at once. I really would have liked working ahead. They only give you 2 weeks for each project and that's a shame. Overall, the course was incredibly interesting and well taught.

You'll get to learn about some low level, classical OS material and get into more modern ideas supporting concurrency, virtualization and distributed systems. Some of the lectures are pretty dense, so you'll probably want to watch them in pieces rather than all at once. There were 3 projects and an extra credit project this semester, and they were all in C. If you don't know C already, this is where the bulk of your difficulty in the class will come from. Some of the code templates given used syntax and operators I'd never seen before, and this created a lot of difficulty for me. If you're well versed in C and navigating Linux man pages already, you're probably fine. Exams were tricky, but I didn't find them exceptionally hard despite their reputation. The course is curved, and the boundaries seemed pretty generous. If you mess up more than one project you can still walk away with a B if your exam scores are above average. \n\nTAs are pretty responsive on Piazza, but don't rely on them to help you at the last minute - ask early and you should be good. Project grades take a long time to return, but this semester had an unusually high number of students so I kind of expected this going in. Make sure to pass Bonnie tests - they seem highly correlated with the end grade of your projects. \n\nThere was also a very active course Slack this semester where you can get fast help if the TAs are online. Professor Gavrilovska holds office hours every week (not just the TAs), so you can get help there too. I'd recommend this course early if you're looking into the Computing Systems specialization and need to brush up on low level OS material, but be warned - it's a deceptive amount of work. Definitely worth taking.",

First of all this is a graduate course, some topics on computer science are vague and does not have formal algorithms or proofs to learn from, this is one such course. You will apply your computer science skills on this course, so like others mentioned here lecture videos are shallow, skimmed through and covered lot of topics.  If you are research oriented, curious to dig through then this course is for you.  Its overwhelming to do 10 quizzes, 1 final and 5 projects. If you are new to security you will spend lot of time like me but in the end you will feel that you learned something from projects.  Initially i had to juggle 3 courses, so i ended up blowing up on 1 assignment which had a big impact on my grades. TAs were very comfortable on regrade requests and did their best. It appears that materials have changed from past semesters, so if you are new to computer security and expect to learn from course videos and apply it to projects, you are not going to like this course. Its true that professor did not show up but i doubt that it would have made any difference due to the nature of the course. If you have hacking mindset and willing to dig through and learn on your own then you will enjoy this course. Don't assume this course is going to be easy, be prepared to put in solid effort if you care for good grade. In terms of programming language, this course needs some understanding on C, javascript, html, python and firewall rules",

For learning R, the course provides sufficient time to learn the language and I also heavily used the DataCamp “Data Analyst with R” track and it made the homework’s and projects a breeze. To tackle algebra and calculus, I referred to Khan Academy. Both these resources are more than sufficient to prepare for the course. \n\n The homework’s, projects and activates are announced up front so that we can plan about them. Make sure you do all the activities since they are extra credits and help if one of the homework or project does not go well. The grading is lenient and it is not difficult to score an A. I think this is a great course to take first up in the program.",

At minimum, I would recommend taking ML4T before this.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the course is the exams. They would make excellent homework problems distributed throughout the semester instead of the ~50-page behemoths we were given. The problems were actually really great in terms of fostering learning outside of the projects, but that value greatly is diminished when you're on a 1-week deadline and are restricted in terms of the materials available to you. I did great on the midterm but by the time the final came around, I was already exhausted by the class and it clearly showed in my grade.",

I would consider myself pretty well versed in C before the class and had some working knowledge of many operating systems mechanisms through using vendor OSs for embedded DSP chips which also lends itself to a decent understanding of computer architecture. \n\nOne of the best features of the class is the slack channel which one of the TAs has generously fronted the cost for. I  saved myself many hours just by doing some cursory scanning of the issues that others were running into on their projects. The TAs that were active in the slack channel were generally helpful as well.\n\nI feel overall the course was paced very well with ample time to do projects (assuming you don't procrastinate too much). Personally, I feel the exams aren't that great probably because they need to resort to a lot of multiple choice, true-false in order for the tests to be gradable. There was an extra credit project for up to 4% of your grade which was graded if you were near a grade border line. Overall, it seems that the curve is extremely generous (it's extremely easy to get a B).",

You'll need to reference the text to complete the quizzes. For the exams, I found that skimming the text for information and then intense flashcard memorization before the test to be a successful strategy. \n\nI liked the structure and presentation of the video lectures. I thought they were organized well and did a great job of distilling relevant information from the text. \n\nFor me the weak point of the class was in terms of the leadership and administration of the course. There were some outstanding TAs in this course, who were generally available to guide students on projects and the concepts underlying them. However, when it came to matters of policy and offering a cohesive message on things that came up, particularly in terms of graded content, there was no unified voice, and sometimes questions would go unanswered. \nThere were some minor snags endured because the course switched from TSquare to Canvas but those were teeny and inconsequential. However, a few times, things that should not have mattered turned into frustrating issues because no one would address them.  This was my fifth course in the program, and I'm not convinced that this frustration is rooted in an unreasonable expectation of course organization and leadership. These courses can't entirely run themselves. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I took this course and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about the topic and has had no exposure to it otherwise. ",

This course does have quite a bit of material that you need to get through in addition to the projects, but I found everything accessible with my CS background.\n\nThe biggest advise I would give for students considering taking this course is to brush up on C ahead of time which will make your first project much easier. If you are taking this course, make sure that you start your projects as soon as possible. Waiting to the last minute just adds stress.\n\nOverall, great course, great instructor.

I got most assignments full grades, plus 70% of the extra credit, but bombed two exams---both are >10 points lower than the median---yet I still got an A. It can be said that the extra credits saved my ass.\n\nContent-wise, the course is basically a survey of some basic AI and ML algorithms, you may actually have heard of implemented some of them in other classes, but still, it gives you an wholistic view of what's in your toolbox, and sometimes they framed it in a way that uses different algorithms to solve the same problem. So it's very useful for anyone who wants to work on AI/ML in the future.",

            "text": "This was a great survey course that tends towards the theory side without heavy math (but there is a lot of math, so define 'heavy' as being relative), but it took a whole lot of work. It's very easy to spend 20-30 hours on each project assignment. Study hard for each exam, and definitely reach Mitchell's textbook in addition to the supplemental material (you can skim papers, but make sure you understand them). If you have pre-canned code to run, this can greatly reduce your assignment time. I found myself writing a lot of my own code, so perhaps I could have saved countless hours if I knew which experiment to run beforehand.\n\nML is a very fair course, and they grade harshly per assignment and exam but do curve up. If you do better than the mean, you'll probably get an A. I screwed up the first assignment because I underestimated the time it took and sent it half complete (no extensions). I did at mean or better afterwards on everything, and it all worked out. They will be reasonable if you do poorly on the first assignment, but demonstrate an upward trajectory afterward.\n\nI took ML and ML4T at the same time, which had some overlap, but I found myself spending every weekend alternating between the two classes. I'd recommend taking ML alone if you're also working full time on a demanding job. I did get A's in both, but I also lost nearly every weekend for 3+ months.",

            "text": "This was my final class of the program and I am now officially finished with grad school (yay!) and this is without a doubt the most time consuming/challenging class I took in the whole program.  To compare it against even the 2nd most challenging class is a huge difference and to be honest this is probably the difficulty level all classes should be for this program.\n\nIf you are taking this class you really need to mentally prepare yourself for the time consuming workload that lays ahead of you.   The class gives you no time to breathe.  Even from day one you need to watch all of the lectures and get started on the first assignment which is due in 3 weeks.  After that you have 3 weeks until the next one is due, then you have 2 weeks until the midterm.  This pattern repeats all the way to the end.  You will never have a week off.\n\nThe assignments are not difficult to code, but very time consuming.  This is because the lectures go over the theory and math behind the algorithms and its up to you to figure out how to actually code them (using libraries.)  One positive is that you can actually steal code.  Yes, you heard that right.  You can Google someone else's code and use it if you want.  I know many people just used the code some previous students created for the class and this is perfectly fine.  I actually coded all 4 assignments myself and learned a lot.\n\nThe biggest problem with this class as others on here have mentioned is you have no idea how well you are doing or if you are even going to pass the class.  Until final grades came out I thought I was going to get a C and was prepared to take the class over again.  I did well on all four assignments (82, 79, 92, 90) which were all above the class mean, but completely bombed the midterm and final (34, 49) and somehow managed to get an A with the huge curve.\n\nIf you are going to take this class, get as much knowledge about ML as you can by pre-watching the class lectures on Udacity, or take one of the many ML courses such as the Andrew NG ML class from Stanford.\n\nOverall this class was great.  It was a ton of work but I learned a lot and will be continuing to study ML and will possibly be thinking about a career change to go into this field.",

After taking the course, I have a much better understanding of regression and the basics of machine learning as well as a pretty solid foundation in R.\n\nI have an undergrad degree in CS from 10 years ago and haven't coded much since then, and I found it fairly straightforward to keep up. The homework assignments and projects were fairly time consuming for me because I didn't know R at all, but they were interesting and I learned a lot. Some weeks I spent 10-15 hours, other weeks I spent 0 because there was only a small extra credit assignment due. I found it fairly easy to get an A.\n\nI watched the lectures religiously early on, but later on I found the class discussions and google to be much more helpful. The TAs were helpful, but honestly I found the other students to be the most helpful. The professor was more of a manager of the TAs than a professor, but that's fine.\n\nI was intimated by the requirements of linear algebra and calculus since I am many years removed from college, but it didn't turn out to be that bad. One assignment requires you to do partial derivatives to come up with the equation you need to implement, but it wasn't too bad to fumble through with the help of Piazza. The other assignments did not require much deep math knowledge.\n\n",

            "text": "BLUF: This course is intro to Python and it goes really well with ISYE 6501. \n\nMy biggest qualm with the course was the length of the midterms. For my class, our 2 midterms each took an average of upwards of 15 hours (we got 24 hours, but it was still quite absurd). Surprisingly, the final only took me 6, even though we got 36 hours to complete it. The exams and homeworks were open book/note with no online proctoring. The only restriction was that we couldn't ask our classmates for help, so I must say that despite my complaint, I can't really say anything was unfair. \n\nI took the course together with ISYE 6501 (Introduction to analytics modeling) and it was kind of neat because we would code up a lot of the algorithms discussed in the modeling course. \n\nThis course is comprised of lectures and Jupyter notebooks. Lectures are well designed as well as homeworks (You get 1 per week and each one took me a few hours to complete with the tv running in the background, nothing crazy). As far as autograders go, I've had much worse experiences than the one in this course. Learning to debug is extremely important, and you will certainly gain some experience in this course. \n\nIn terms of course content, this is what I imagine is taught at the Python 101 level,  with a sprinkle of harder topics. Many of the weeks went something like: \"Here is an analytics technique/algorithm. Code it in Python. Python already has a built-in function for it, this is how that call goes...\" This is actually a pretty good way to learn, because you essentially teach yourself the way that some of Python's functions work by coding them manually thus giving yourself a good introduction to Python, programming in general and the analytics models.",

I owe all my learning to my fellow classmates. \n",

            "text": "This was a fun class, with a few frustrating aspects. The class was pretty basic, with the exception of homework #3 which was very calculus heavy (which I have no experience with) and there wasn't much explanation for the math needed. For the rest of the class it was very easy, mostly just homework assignments where you had to shuffle data into different formats and then use libraries to display the data.\n\nOne frustrating aspect was that homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. They often took 3-6 weeks to be graded. Part of the problem was that several TAs had accidents or unplanned events happen and so other semesters of this class may not experience such a long delay.\n\nI also wish that there had been more helpful feedback on assignments, usually they just marked the number of points you missed with a short comment to what section was wrong, but the comments were usually very cryptic.\n\nDr. Joyner was very kind when you approached him with grading questions and there were several times when an assignment would be awarded points because there were several students that missed a single question or because something wasn't very clear.\n\nOn average I spent 7 hours and 48 minutes per week, but there were some weeks where I did a lot more than others and the range is from 1:20 to 16:41 (that was one of the project 2 weeks).\n\nI would recommend studying calculus (which is does mention on the course info page) before homework 3, but other than that this was a pretty easy class.",

I work full-time and took this course along with Network Security. I pulled one allnighter for this course because I am a champion at procrastinating, and even then, I could have just used one of the two 48-hour late day passes everyone is given. I even bombed one of the first assignments and ended up with a 97% in the class with all the extra credit they give out towards the end.\n\nI test much better than my actual understanding, so I found the tests fun and engaging and both the midterm and final had a generous curve (60%->90% and 76%->100% in my case). I would recommend going over the textbook somewhat thoroughly, or at least know where the relevant sections are, since on both tests, I managed to basically transfer pseudocode from the book onto the test for an entire question. Also have the solution manual to the book handy (there's a bunch of pdfs online). On the midterm, one of the questions was almost identical to the last year's midterm solutions. \n\nIf you're worried about taking this class, just take it and stay engaged on Slack and Piazza. Since it's usually a smaller class, all the students are very helpful and the professor and TAs were phenomenal. I started some projects 2-3 days before they were due (spending about 4-7 hours a day on it) and did fine by utilizing other people's questions and answers on Piazza and Slack. I don't recommend that because every single time, I would start an assignment and panic that I wouldn't crack the algorithm in time, but you should not panic if life gets ahead of you a bit and you neglect this class for a week or two.

            "text": "Machine Learning for trading is an excellent course. It's a great starter course, as it isn't too difficult, but beware that the difficulty does ramp up towards the end of the course (though it still doesn't get exceptionally difficult) so don't let the first half fool you into thinking the second half is just as easy. Lecture material is very interesting, essentially being split into half-financial and half-intro to machine learning.\n\nThe projects all build upon one another in some way, so it's advisable to spend a sufficient amount of time making sure each one is done properly. You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. **DO NOT** wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including *assess_learners*. \n\nI would suggest making sure your *marketsim* project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are *assess_learners*, *manual_strategy* and *strategy_learner*, with the latter two using your *marketsim* code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for *manual_strategy* you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for *strategy_learner* so it's good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\n\nThere are two proctored exams,  one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren't difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\n\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.  TAs were responsive and easy to reach on PIazza, though Dr. Balch is often very helpful he can be a bit curt.",

There are *3 assignments*, *a 3-stage class project*, and *peer-reviews* for all assignments and project stages.\n\n**Assignments**:The 3 assignments are essentially essays that ask you to leverage class material to either a specific topic or a topic of your choosing (depending on the assignment). You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it's not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\n\n**Projects**:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don't feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don't neglect the written reflection too, as it's normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\n\n**Exams**:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren't too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you  have a week to complete each exam.\n\n**Peer Review**:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don't want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\n\n**TAs**: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza. There were a few grading hiccups towards the end of this semester, but they were rapid in addressing these issues and correcting mistakes where necessary. I believe the prof, Dr. Goel, is stepping down and there will be a new prof so I'm not so sure if the exact structure of the course will be as described above, so take these notes with a grain of salt.\n\n**Prep**: This is a good first class, but if you aren't comfortable with Python or Java then you should get brush up on one of these prior to starting the class. Most people use Python, and if you want to complete the alternate Chatbot project, it is **only Python**.  Prepare for a lot of writing, as in total I wrote about 11-13k words across all assignments, project reflections, and exams.",

            "text": "One of the courses with the most genuinely involved instructors. They are actually around all the time and are still experimenting with and improving the course even though this is one of the oldest courses in the program. Professor Goel is going to stop teaching this course starting next semester, but it will still be taught by Professor Joyner (and Bobbie Eicher), so you can still expect a lot of instructor involvement. The course does open book exams without proctortrack, which is personally my favorite mode of doing exams since proctortrack is so constraining. Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that's what you want to do.\n\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn't really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don't think I've been convinced: there is *a lot* of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague. Also there seems to be a lot of repetition in the material, where techniques that are extremely similar get presented separately due to what I think are very minor differences.\n\nIn summary: this is a well-taught course. It does require you to write a lot but you don't need to be a genius to get an A, just do your work consistently. However, don't expect your mind to be blown by the material, and be aware that you are learning about an area of AI that is now fairly outdated.",

The math was never overwhelming, and our arguments aren't required to be excessively rigorous as long as they are valid. \n\nI am very excited that I now understand things like linear programing, max flow, the fast Fourier transform and RSA pretty well: all these seemed completely mysterious to me before I took this class but they all turned out to be pretty easy to understand from the lectures.\n\nThe format of the exams and assignments is a pretty weird: you are given a template that you need to print, fill out and **scan** (there are phone apps to do that). Technically for the assignments you can just edit the LaTeX but for the exams you do have to scan your filled out template while being filmed by ProctorTrack... Weird.\n\nAlso be aware that there are **a lot** of exams (3 \"midterms\" and 1 final) and that the assignments and projects count for very little (5% for the assignments, 15% for the project).\n\nOne criticism however: especially at the beginning of the class, I ended up needing to do a lot of regrade requests for my assignments and first exam which I felt were graded incorrectly harshly. Out of 4 regrade requests I did, 3 got accepted, which shows that there was indeed some excessively zealous grading going on. Things got better as the class went on, but if you take this class, do check your feedback carefully and don't hesitate to request regrades if something seems way wrong.",

            "text": "This was my second OMSCS course and by far one of the best courses I've taken at a university level.  I say best in term of the rich amount of material that's covered in the lectures and projects which further reinforce (THREE projects + 1 extra credit project offered but optional) the theory.  The class will require you to work very hard to complete the projects.  They give you starter code and a description of what's expected.  You will find yourself googling how to do things like setting up TCP sockets or using Shared Memory IPC etc.  A good background in C will help in this course as all the projects require using C language.  Slack and Piazza are good places to look for answers / ask when you are stuck; 7/10 times someone else has already asked the question.\n\nTo prepare for C, read and practice some examples on Arrays, Pointers (understand pointer arithmetic also), Structures, Function Pointers (used to do Callbacks), Dynamic memory allocation and freeing using malloc() and free().\n\nUbuntu operating system is used for the projects.  I used Virtual Box to run Ubuntu but perhaps my computer is sluggish and the VM was annoyingly sluggish.  I would recommend running it natively off of a partition if you can.   I have two monitors but could only use 1 with VirtualBox, I could look into enabling the 2nd monitor but I didn't even try considering how sluggish it already was.\n\nThe exams were challenging but fair.  If you go through all the lectures and understand the content and do the quiz examples and sample exam, you will be prepared for the exam.  It is a lot of content so do keep pace with the schedule while working on the projects.  I got through the class without buying the recommended books.\n\nThe course will get challenging and you might lose hope at times but keep going.  Here are sample scores from a previous semester and what grades it translated to with the curve.  I wish I had this information earlier in the semester:\n\nExample 1: Project 1 - 80 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 70%, Project 4 - 75%, Midterm - 90%, Final - 85% --> 87%, Participation - 5% (max) = A\n\nExample 2: Project 1 - 60 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 45%, Project 4 - 50%, Midterm - 80%, Final - 75%, Participation - 2% --> 65% = B\n\nProfessor Ada is passionate about this course and going above and beyond to help students.  She holds a weekly session going over project and class questions.  This was very helpful.  I did not pay much attention to this till half way through the semester.  It really does help understand the project requirements.  The TA's are also helpful in answering question in Piazza and Slack.\n\nIt was a lot of work but I'm glad I took this class.  It really makes you appreciate what the Operating System does behind the scene.  Even if you don't do Systems level programming in your career, you will have a stronger foundation in computing.  Best of luck if you take this class!",

I had very little experience coding in C++, and I had never coded in C before. The first two projects were in C, while the last two projects were in C++. I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.<br>\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.<br>\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.<br>\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class.",

            "text": "This is the stalwart of the Curly/Smoov two-fer in the ML specialization. Many people are initially turned off by the open-ended nature of the class, but that's really the genius of it - to encourage intellectual exploration that would otherwise not happen if a clear and concise rubric was given to be followed.\n\nI had completed ML4T and RL previously, and those really helped with the course - particularly in understanding the grading style of the projects and with the RL parts of the course. Though having done only ML4T would have been more than sufficient in a successful experience in ML.\n\nStart on the projects on the day that they are assigned, and attending office hours, are key to succeeding in the projects. The exams are difficult and require a depth and breadth of understanding the material - there's no getting cute around that.\n\nOverall, an excellent class that is well designed and the student definitely gets as much as he puts into the class.\n",

They are essentially Prof Serban standing in front of a camera reading slides for an entire semester. Many of the questions on the quizzes/midterms/etc seemed to be open for interpretation and were debated extensively on Piazza. Many of the multiple choice & T/F questions were also very focused on technical theory (i.e \"what is the sampling distribution of the prediction of future responses under the Poisson regression model\") , which is fine for Stats majors, but for OMSA, I will not be retaining this level of detail. The examples were great and the R code provided with the examples gave a great starting point for HWs/Exams. For me, the workload was pretty light. It was essentially 1 week watching videos, 1 week HW, 1 week peer review... repeat 5x & mix in midterms/final. I averaged maybe 4 hours a week and finished with B+. Also- office hours w/ Prof Serban were @ 4 ET- they were recorded, but with only 1-2 students showing up, they were not very useful. I did learn a great deal about regression, but just did not feel engaged by this format.",

The TAs were very responsive (usually my Piazza posts were responded to in less than an hour, and they were also almost always available on Slack for quick queries) and most of the time they were helpful without giving the lab away. Having said that, one of the labs was slightly problematic in that you either understood it or you didn't, and there was no help that could be given (other than \"don't overthink it\") without giving it away. However, this lab is being reworked for next semester, so that should no longer be an issue.\n\nIf you come into this class without knowing C++ (pointers and STL containers), C, Java and shell scripting to some degree, you are going to have a hard time. However, if you know these already, the class is not that hard. Some of the labs are head scratchers, but once you figure out what you need, you should have no difficulty completing them.\n\nIn summary, it's an interesting course, and, if you know how to program (and if you don't why are you doing a masters in CS?) then you should have no difficulty passing.\n\nOne other thing. Although I put down six hours per week, I actually did 11 hours some weeks and 1 hour on other weeks (watching a lecture) because the labs were due every two weeks. But that distribution has more to do with me putting off the labs until a few days before they were due rather than any issue with the course.",

            "text": "This was my first OMSCS course. I come from a mechanical engineering background, with only done 1 C project over a year ago during my senior year embedded computing class and capstone project. I've done some self-studying and programming at work, so not completely disconnected from the programming world. \n\nI knew that I would struggle a bit to understand and relearn C so I gave myself extra time to do the projects (START EARLY) and stay consistent with a strict schedule. With a full time job and no kids, this class was my life for these few months.\n\nOne key thing I struggled with in the beginning was to set up your environment. They say there are a bunch of ways to do it and you can do it however you would like, but from a beginner's perspective and not knowing anything about how to set up an environment, I would have appreciated it if they had ONE default suggestion. After a week or two of struggling to get a proper environment set up, I finally found a working environment. I used VM VirtualBox to install Ubuntu (which they should have instructions/find instructions on internet), then for IDE in Ubuntu I used VisualStudio Code. This IDE was great because I figured out how to do debugging (there is a youtube video on debugging with VSC in Ubuntu), and you can debug with multiple VSC windows, essentially stepping through multiple interacting programs (debugging client AND server at the same time).\n\nA tip is to be active on the Slack channel. It can be difficult to keep up with all the activity going on, but if you put in the time and effort, you can sometimes gain some really helpful pointers and tips. That is why it is recommended to really start early and find your problems/roadblocks early, and you can be on the lookout for a solution in the Slack channel. To get the most out of the Slack channel, I learned that you need to be very precise with the wording of your questions and try your best to communicate that through text. That will allow the TA's or students to better help  answer your questions. Don't be afraid to ask your questions, but be specific and think about how to phrase it in a way for other people to understand (explaining code and technical stuff through text can be very confusing and difficult).\n\nAnother tip is try to meet up with students locally. Having someone to talk to and discuss project ideas and course concepts is VERY helpful. Of course please beware of plagiarism and misconduct according to the course rules.\n\nProjects were absolutely great! Coming from someone with very little C programming experience, I had so much to gain. Of course they might change the project contents every semester, but our semester it was fair amount of work with the given time. The first project was the most daunting because everything was so foreign to me. The VM, which IDE to use, how to debug, socket programming (concepts I've never done nor was it taught in the videos); it was overwhelming at first... so START EARLY. Project 3 was by far the most fun (get a whiteboard) with the design aspect. Project 4 was the most difficult to wrap your head around, but once you figure it out, you will say: \"What that's it?...\"\n\nIf you finish the projects and pass all the automated tests with a decent readme, you should be able to get 100 on the projects. I did right at average for the midterm, and a little below average on the final (disappointed with my performance), but I surprisingly got an A in the course!\n\nAll in all, in my opinion this was a perfect first OMSCS course. It will definitely not be easy, but if you put the time and hard work in, you shall be rewarded!",

            "text": "*TLDR*: This is a graduate program, you are expected to work hard and work beyond what is provided to you. This course is an intro to ML/Data Science. Don't take it if you took ML already. \n\nThis was my first class at GT. I paired it along with KBAI. Although it's recommended to not take more than one class at a time, it wasn't my first time taking online classes, so I knew how to deal with the self-discipline of handling an online class. That being said:\n\nThe class wasn't difficult, but it was challenging. The first half of the course is a breeze (assuming you have programming experience and know basic statistics/visualizations). The second half of the course was more challenging, but it's where you learn. We implemented Logistic Regression from scratch, had to derive the cost function (partial derivative), and analyzed datasets, etc. The course serves more as an intro to Data Science as it covers visualizing data, cleaning data, modeling data, and deriving conclusions from data, overall making you think like a Data Scientist. I don't have a formal ML background (although I work in a Data Analytics team, so I'm exposed to it), so a lot of this material was not new for me. I do believe this is a good intro to ML/Data Science. \n\nOn another note, you will have to do independent studying to handle the 2nd half of the course. Prof Lebanon is quite dry and personally it was very difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Also, I didn't enjoy his teaching style. I made good use of Andrew Ng's ML course in order to understand some of the topics discussed in the second half.\n\nHaving completed only one of the extra credit tasks (called Activities), I ended up with an A. Professor Joyner taking over is probably the best thing that could've happened to this class. \n\nOne annoying part of this class however was how unprepared some students seemed to have been for a graduate program of this caliber (this is one of the easier courses of the program). Piazza was almost unbearable with the amount of simplistic questions that could have either been figured out independently or by a simple google search. I understand lots of people don't come from a CS/Software Engineering background, but the amount of hand holding some people needed/expected was almost ridiculous.",

The homework assignments were pretty solid and the format of using Jupyter notebooks was really nice.  \n\nThe worst part of the course were the exams.  They were quite lengthy and exhausting.  It felt like the homework didn't prepare you at all for the exam so there was a lot of trying to research and learn stuff during the exam which adds to the amount of time needed to complete it.  That said, the final was relatively easy compared to the midterms so that was nice.  One thing that I didn't figure out until the final that might have been helpful for the midterms: instead of spending an entire work day (8 hours) on the exam, work 4 hours one night, then go to sleep, work 4 hours the next day.  The only down side to this is that if you need all 24 hours to complete the exam, you waste some up front (note, the longest I spent on an exam was only 13 hours or so). ",
