            "text": "(To be updated hopefully once the term ends)\nThe class this semester started on the wrong foot, and the general experience had been sour since then. It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

It felt very rough - there's little lecture and many assignments required considerable time searching the web to figure out things you needed that weren't in the class material. Students found the assignments ambiguous, and piazza questions were answered very slowly and not in a clear manner. The original professor, Dr. Lebanon, was swapped out for Dr. Chakraborty and I just felt he wasn't really prepared for the class. Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

TAs are very lazy and don't answer the questions or answered in a very misleading way. Then at grading stage, they will surprise you and interpret the question in a different way it is being asked, and deduct points from the students. A few classic examples: 1. what is the growth rate of different format of file size? (They graded with big(O) notation) 2. Describe your observation (grading notes released after three weeks of submission saying, you can't say A is bigger than B, you have to say A is 4% and B is 3%, so A is bigger than B). The answer is in the figure the students submit, but the reason most of us didn't put them in the final conclusion is the assignment didn't ask it in the beginning. \nDefinitely the worst course have been seen in OMSCS",

I had to withdraw since my first midterm grade was very poor and the instructor had no intentions of giving a curve even though the class average was failing! Nobody got an A on the first exam and the exam did a poor job of gauging my understanding of the material since it was all T/F questions with 3 ineligible Multiple choice questions (we could not see the diagrams properly). Despite all of the students complaints, the instructors simply ignored them and moved on. On top of that, we never even got the answer key for the first exam so I don't know what I got wrong (or could argue for any points back). \n\nThe mini projects could be fun; however, the lectures do not show how to solve them at all. I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class. It is sad because the material looks so cool but the lack of structure, direction, and overall unfairness of this class has lead me to believe that this is the worst class I have ever taken as a student (and this was my 8th class in the program).",

Assignments lacke specifics in a lot of cases, making them harder than they should have been. Further, the two middle assignments were based on depricated APIs with not much in terms of information available on them, making those assignment even harder. The assignments and class lectures loosely fit together, but not well. \nAs for the exams, the mid-term was open book, but the material on the actual midterm exam did not match that covered in the provided practice midterm, nor in the office hours \"midterm review\" sessions. Granted, you were given 3 hrs to complete the midterm, but when the average grade was somewhere between 27-32 out of 50, something is just not right. \nI decided to drop the course after lack-luster performance on the midterm as well as several assignments, also after asking professor / TAs for help or clarification. The assignments and midterm were returned with virtually no explanation of what was done wrong, making learning from mistakes difficult at best. Further, when approached, the TAs / professor gave generic answers that did not really help much. \nMy advice, proceed with caution if you choose to take this course. Avoid it if you can, its not worth the time investment or hassle.",

            "text": "Background: I'm a software engineer working in parallel algorithm implementation using C++, married with no kids, and this is my 9th class in the program. \n\nThere is a project consisting of writing a compiler for the language Tiger. You're provided with a scanner that gives you a tagged token stream and you have to write a top-down, table-driven parser, modify the grammar to make it LL(1) or as close as you can get, and produce four-address code that assumes unlimited registers as an intermediate representation. In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance. \n\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself. As it is a table-driven parser, your best bet is to write a code-generator that parses your grammar spec and creates the table, which is what something like yacc or ANTLR does, but you're not allowed to use those and have to write your own parser generator. \n\nThere is also a written homework every few weeks, similar to CCA in that you need to answer some think-cases, but much easier in that you’re just working through existing algorithms, not devising your own and proving they work. There is also a comprehensive final. \n\nAlthough it’s a first run, the course feels like a finished product. It is very well-run with clear requirements and the material is fantastic. Be prepared to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to get a working product unless you’ve done this before, but it is well worth it and extremely satisfying to see your baby in the wild. You’ll leave with the know-how to create your own basic programming language.",

GaTech couldn't find a professor to teach so they made Arpana Chakraborty, a Udacity course developer/instructor as an adjunct lecturer to teach under the GaTech brand. In his own words, \"I apologize for being absent for the past couple of weeks; I've been busy with work outside of this class\", excuse me? He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade. One big reason I join OMSCS was to avoid this kind of teaching. GaTech needs to evaluate the staff carefully to uphold and preserve the integrity of this program. I suggest the staff take the playbook from other courses like ML4T or CP or KBAI for future version of this course.",

This is sixth OMSCS course and by far one of the worst three courses I have ever taken in my entire life. I would quite the program if this were my first course. The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late. The last two extra credited assignment were obviously rushed out and questionably violating schools rules. Received \"A\", but this does not change facts.",

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results).",

Too much of ambiguity, too much of (needless) load, makes learning second priority., e. g. Use of loops, run it 5 times, 10 times, 500 times, sorta questions, asking Complexity, No doubt this is essentials, but DVA is not meant for that. \nAnd cryptic messages for communication, asking TA's Or Prof. question over piazza or slack, u get very terse/generic feedback.

Like any stupid student I dared sometime, to re-ask the next question, to get No further reply. \nSome of my Piazza posts remained, unanswered. If I pass this course, it would be because of my own work and students who were active and prompt on piazza. \nNewly hired Prof. n TA's, Couldn't make this course interesting, neither they could make us realize potential of the course.

I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily.

Unfortunately for me, my reading comp is not what it used to be!!\n\nThe projects were great at demonstrating the subject material. However, from a non-CS background, they were INCREDIBLY (for me) time consuming, and occasionally frustrating. However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS.

You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked.

Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA.

IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early).",

Two of the projects involved recreating results from academic papers. In addition, it is recommended that students read through 22 academic papers throughout the course. While you can survive the course without reading most of the academic papers, it shows where the focus is. \n\nHomework felt completely unrelated to lecture material, the time needed to do homework assignments varied wildly and some of the homework and project timelines were unrealistic unless you can stay way ahead of schedule. \n\nOverall, the course felt in some ways like a disservice to the material it covers. The course material is interesting and can be used to solve very cool problems like those seen on OpenAI, however it only spent a small portion of the time solving interesting problems.",

Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort. I imagine it will provide a good head start for the CV course, but I have not taken that... yet!",

Of course, my old friend Will is great as usual, I will perhaps miss his long but detailed posts on piazza in the future. \n\nBeing a graduate course, the topics covered here are fundamental, but never assume an easy \"A\". This course, arguably, has the lowest percentage of \"A\" among all the OMSCS courses. The exam questions are purposely tricky. There were four exams in total, the grade mediums are below 80 (out of 100) except one exam. Though my grades are 2~4 sd higher than the medium, but I do not believe that tricky questions are good to motivate studies. Another thing I would approach differently is the course content, instead of emphasizing on EER diagram which is essentially a formalization to represent information, I prefer to dig deeper in more practical issues, e. g., query performance optimization, normalization, or non-SQL database. In addition, I suggest to remove exam #3 for SQL and move the questions to other exams, there are so many moving parts in the course, which makes it hard to follow. \n\nIn the group project, we were asked to build a fully functional web application with a database back-end. This is not hard but you have to invest serious amount of time. I am having a hard time to believe people only spent five hours per week can contribute much to the project.

The programming projects are based on 1) socket programming, general C, and multithreading, 2) IPC, and 3) RPC. The first two projects were sizable endeavors, and the third was much less intense. I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading. \n\nOVERALL:\nMy first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in.

Grade was determined based on 8 problem sets (partially auto-graded), peer feedback, and a final exam. Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going “above and beyond” what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester).

Having problem sets assigned solely as preparation for the five exams (each worth 20%) was great. We could propose solutions on Piazza and have TA’s or the instructor Chris Pryby (who were fantastic, btw) respond and give us hints and feedback. Tests were difficult, but fair, and there were opportunities to make up for some lost points on previous exams. No doubt the material is hard and might take some students a few semesters to get an A or B (particularly ones that have never seen the material before), but this is one class that I would recommend to anyone seeking a Master’s degree in this program.",

            "text": "This class taught me a lot about finance, but having been through ML, RL, and DVA (first run), I did not find this class particularly enjoyable. While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn’t come until the latter third of the class. I’ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I’ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material.",

However, the 4 tests also cover EER, relational algebra, relational calculus, EER to relational mapping, function dependencies, normalization, file organization, and indexing. Exam averages were 74, 71, 85, 69, but project grades had much higher averages, 87 and 90 for the first two phases. The full-stack project this semester was very time consuming, but the database parts were less than the majority of the work in phase 3. Choose your teammates wisely and finish phase 3 coding early because there is an exam and extra work in the form of sample data (3k lines of SQL inserts in our case) and a demo to prepare at the end. Phase three of the project is primarily graded via the demo where you checkout the code from github, load the sample data into MySQL and walk through the demo via Bluejeans with a TA in 25 minutes or less. Check the schedule for your semester, and if its the same, yes, finish coding early. They are not kidding about the importance of practicing the demo. Recent topics like NoSQL and big data are not covered, yet. As mentioned by other reviewers, Prof. Jay Summet was very engaged on Piazza. He and the TAs were extremely helpful answering questions about the material on Piazza and the regularly scheduled office hours. The class was well organized and well run.",

They also give you a week to complete the exam so there's no real studying for it and you should expect to spend 10-15 hours on it. The assignments are fun but don't relate to each other so you will learn a lot about the subject then completely erase your memory for the next subject.

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future. I am proceeding under the assumption the professor will take CIOS feedback to heart. But if he doesn't, I would avoid his classes in the future.",

There was also an optional project which meant even if you struggled on a project or exam you could still fare ok. Project 1 was C-based, and having some acquaintance with C was nice, though I think one could manage if familiar with another language. Project 2 was not especially language dependent. Project 3 required some basic python skills. Project 4 required you to be able to read or write HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, but having only minimal familiarity with those I was still able to figure it out, so I wouldn't over-stress about those. \n\nThere was a ton of lecture material for the course, which got tiresome. In particular, the videos for the first half of the course are extremely long-winded and even at 1. 5x or 2x were quite repetitive. \n\nMany of the quiz questions are lifted verbatim from the textbook.

I had a hard copy of an old edition and it was definitely adequate. \n\nAlthough I was successful on the exams, they didn't feel like especially high quality assessments.

Luckily a couple of the TAs were helpful via Piazza or available for consultation office hours and peers were helpful on Piazza.

The course is divided into three modules - basically numpy applications to finance, intro to finance, and machine learning (with a focus on finance). \n\nThe ML projects were the most work. It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them. \n\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza. There was around a week near a critical deadline where they vanished which proved to be quite frustrating for many, but in the end I think being very active 15 out of 16 weeks vastly surpasses the quality of interaction I've found in other classes.",

Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer. \n\nOn the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent \"quizzes\" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you. \n\nToo often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you. When it was time for a project, it was like being sat at the controls for one of the giant mixers or something, told to push the red button, and write down how much chocolate comes out. \n\nI scored over a 100 (due to extra credit), but still I wish I could have a do-over and take something else instead.",

            "text": "Warning about previous reviews: I found many of the claims in previous reviews to be INACCURATE: that the exams didn't test student's understanding, that the exams didn't look like the practice exams, that the assignments lacked specifics, that the lectures didn't help with the assignments, or that the documentations of libraries/frameworks/tools for the assignments were lacking. \n\nThe exams and assignments' questions were among the best quality in all of the classes that I've taken so far. Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code. Also, Dr. Pryby and the TAs were responsive, fair, helpful, and awesome.",

But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really? I got As on the first two but a C on the final, so maybe they were adjusting the difficulty as they went along. Then again I didn't really study very hard for the final since I was focused on my other course... \n\nMy \"5 hours\" is a guess; I didn't keep track.

The instructor and TAs all seemed great and response time to questions and concerns was near immediate. But I acted like they didn't exist except the few times I had a specific question, and I suspect my learning suffered for it. \n\nThe lectures comprise the bulk of the learning material, along with journal articles assigned for most lectures. Most of those aren't too difficult, skewing towards older and easier to digest articles. Ada's a great lecturer and I have few complaints about the quality of the lessons. The recurring \"toyshop\" metaphor felt like a gimmick and wasn't particularly edifying, however. Some of the topics chosen were a little mysterious -- it's unclear to me how remote procedure calls, for example, are a good topic for an OS fundamentals class. \n\nYou'll spend most of your time on the projects. If you know any C at all they shouldn't be too difficult... though through a combination of poor planning and lapses in intelligence I couldn't figure out the synchronization necessary for Project 3 and received an extremely low score. Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class. I'll likely get a B, but if I'd applied myself a little better an A would have been achievable. More importantly, I've grasped the fundamentals well enough to have a base for continued learning.

There are some really useful ones though so keep an eye on that. \n\nThe class's Piazza is really active and Dr. Joyner is quick to reply there and on Slack as well. Your mentor may be a hit or miss. My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are.

This included an absent instructor, a sarcastic TA, vague/contradicting assignment instructions, and extremely late grade returns. I (wisely) withdrew from the course the day before the deadline because I could not handle the stress. I regretted my decision at first, but the class did not get any better. Some say it got worse. I know this because I kept up with it on Slack and Piazza. All this being said, I feel like I would have gotten an A or a B in the course had I kept with it, but it would have put too much of a strain on my mental state. \n\nThe content itself is genuinely useful and interesting. I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate. Many of the people \"complaining\" (including myself) have successfully completed many OMSCS courses without the kinds of issues experienced in this class.",

He find every opportunity to give out extra credits. I learned little from this course.

But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions. It all works, but it's a bit duct-taped together. \n\nOverall a continually fun and interesting class with phenomenal instructor involvement.",

Personally I thought that on the contrary learning about photography is obviously an essential part of mastering Computational Photography, which is also why I enjoyed the \"Camera Obscura\" homework that some people have criticized below. \n\nThe \"mandatory\" part of the assignments is pretty easy (I recommend learning about advanced indexing in numpy, which makes most of the coding trivial), but it only counts for 90% of your grade on the assignment. The remaining 10% is \"Above & Beyond\", which I find very motivating in terms of expanding your learning, and it can be pretty hard to get a full 100% on an assignment. Because that was what I aimed for, my workload was fairly high and the course was of Medium difficulty for me instead of Easy. If you just do the bare minimum, the course might qualify as Easy, but your odds of getting an A will be much lower. \n\nI haven't taken CV but it is clear that there is some overlap, so if you've taken CV you will probably have an easier time in CP.",

ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

In the previous semester, Dr. Lebanon was very involved and helped students understand the assignment intent. This semester, Dr. Chakraborty was MIA most of the semester. The grading was inconsistent, the TAs were frequently combative, and the instructor's solutions to problems were frequently terrible. \n\nOur final exam appears to have been written at the last minute. Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice. This class really should be taught in Python and should cover more relevant topics like the on campus course. I doubt Dr. Chakraborty will be back, but unless the lectures/topics are reviewed, I cannot recommend that anyone take this course.",

They don't teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what's on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don't have supporting materials. If you google it, it's hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references. \n2. The assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It's hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot. \n3. The exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn't not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50. You do the math. \n4. TA's are very active and very friendly, professor only showed up a couple of times in office hours. \nIn conclusion, it's a hard class because of the way it is taught, barely covering topics and expecting from you to become an expert. Be careful if you are going to take this course.",

I did have a bit of a crunch at the end of the semester, as I didn't have my full data available for analysis until about a week before the final project was due, which meant that I put in a lot of hours the last week analyzing data and writing. \n\nDavid Joyner describes this class as a mini Ph. D. and I think it's a perfect description. You explore your educational interests, propose a project, have it accepted, do the project, and defend your results. Many students picked difficult projects, put in a lot of hours, and produced amazing results. Other students put less in and got less out. I have a paper that is close to being ready for publication that I do intend to submit this summer to its intended journal. Since there's currently no research track available in OMS, this class was a welcome bit of research. I'd love to see more classes like it if not a full research path available for OMS students!

The instructors were so vague on how grading worked that I had no idea if I was going to pass or not.",

Provided assignment instructions were not really helpful. In our internet traffic assignment, they provided instructions to use deprecated API that simply never worked so I don't know if they actually tried to implement it themselves. Students had to figure out on our own how to set up everything and solve the problem the other way. \n- Instructors provided little to no guidance but most TAs were very helpful. \n\nDespite getting an A, this was really unpleasant and stressful experience.

            "text": "It sounds cliche, but this class is what you make of it. You are the primary driver of what you learn. During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing. \n\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up. You will ultimately learn only what you choose to learn. If you want an easy A you could likely get that done, but honestly it would be a waste if you don't use the opportunity to push yourself.",

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The approach that the class takes on exams is to get you to take your knowledge to the next level, rather than testing what you learned directly. This could be a good thing or a bad thing; depends on how you look at it. \n\nThe assignments are okay. Their goals are really exciting (parallel list ranking, the N-Body problem, distributed communication collectives, TeraSort, and funnel-sort), but I thought the instructions were a bit lacking. I'd say I spent 40% of my time trying to understand the skeleton code, another 40% learning about the goal of the assignment, 15% coding, and 5% learning things about C. \n\nWhile working on the assignments I found myself more stressed out and frustrated than focusing on putting my knowledge into practice. However, they're continually improving this course, so I anticipate that this will change in the near future. \n\nI do feel quite accomplished after finishing the course, and for what it's worth I took this as my first course while working full time, plus my wife and I had just had our first baby a couple of months before the class started, and I was able to pull off an A. So if you're up for the challenge, then I say go for it, you're learn some really cool stuff.",

Some papers go really in depth in the topic like how DNS works, etc. You also learn to use machine learning to check for network anomaly and then to bypass it which is cool.

I was not able to do all of the readings even spending 30 hours. If you only want to pass the class with a C or B then the 10 hour estimates are correct. First two weeks of class is only about 5 hours but it ramps up quickly. \n\nIf you are aiming for an A the majority of your time will be spent on above and beyond (independent research) and writeups. Expect about 2-3 hours a week on lecture (take notes while watching!), 5 hours on coding for complex base parts of assignments, 3-5 hours on writeup for base assignment, and the remaining time on independent research (both coding and writeups). Also a variable amount of time on taking your own photographs depending on the project. \n\nThe course will be undergoing a revision this fall so hopefully the workload comes down.

But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time. The grading structure is designed such that each homework assignment has an \"Above and Beyond\" section that counts for 10%, so to get anything higher than a 90, you'll need to develop something beyond the basic requirements of the assignment.

After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment.",

The lectures are mostly enjoyable to watch, with joking and puns between the professors, and only occasionally does it feel like the lecture discussion goes off on a tangent or doesn't represent the material well. \nThat's the good news. \nNow the bad. Grading is nonsensical at times, you may get contradictory feedback like \"You should have talked about X... \" followed a sentence or two later by \"I see you did mention X... \" and yet you will still get docked 20% without good reason. You will be told things like \"You don't need to memorize formulas\" and \"You won't need a calculator\" for the exam, and then the exam will expect you to have memorized a formula and do the formula calculations by hand or in your head without a calculator. The grading curve is complete nonsense, you can \"fail\" by traditional standards and still get an A in the class. The assignments will not come with complete expectations in the requirements, you may get some more of the requirements by bugging the TA's during office hours but it is still not guaranteed. If you ask for an example of what is expected you will be told \"No, because then you might parrot the example\" and the professor wants you to \"be creative\" except that the TA's will penalize you for missing something expected in the hidden grading rubric that they wouldn't tell you about or give you an example of. Responses on Piazza are few and slow, especially for such a large class. Slack is a much better source of quick information but it may not be \"good\" information when it comes to things like the hidden grading rubric. \nThe class seems to be run, and definitely graded, as though it were a meta commentary on the accuracy of machine learning in general. Putting in the effort that would get you 100% in other classes will inexplicably result in much worse results in this class even if you still get an A in the end.",

I have passed with a B and feel proud of myself for having made it through. It was by far the toughest course among the 6 courses in my last 4 semesters. I would not say it was Maths heavy but it does require brushing up some basics and keeping them handy for proofs/calculations throughout the course. Prof. Pryby's youtube video lectures helped a lot during the initial part of the course. Video lectures on Udacity were dreadful. As the course progressed, I got a hang of things. Like others have stated, working on problem sets helped prepare for the exams. No matter how hard I prepared for all the 5 exams, I never felt confident before, after and during the exam, infact I always felt like I was going to fail. I somehow maintained 9s and 10s out of 15 throughout, which got me a B towards the end. It took me 4 tests to finally get a 5/5 on a question. I have to say that there were several moments where I felt like giving up, but I held on. I remember looking at the sample problem sets and exam questions before the course started; absolutely nothing made any sense. Just like everyone else, I too have learned a lot but at the same time I feel like there is so much I still don't know :)",

The programming portions of the course were fairly basic, even for a novice programmer such as myself. Brushing up on python syntax and data structures should be enough to complete the projects. \n\nBe prepared to spend a lot of time on Piazza asking questions and reading your classmates posts, as the instructions given in the lectures and projects may at times be vague or difficult to understand. The instructors generally do a very good job at responding to questions. \n\nThe tests vary in difficulty. I found the first test to be the easiest with the following test increasing in difficulty. The tests are provided in ProctorTrack and you are given a two hour window to complete them. However, all of them can easily be completed in under an hour. \n\nBetween the lectures, papers, and projects a lot of information is thrown at you. Some stuck and a lot did not, but I still learned a good deal. Overall, I would highly suggest this course if you are a new student. It is highly structured and requires little base knowledge, allowing you to ease into the OMSCS program. Just be prepared to do the work and allocate some time to study before the tests.",

However, the quality of the lectures is perhaps the best I have ever experienced in OMSCS. (The only thing that bothered me was one of the fonts used - a carbon copy of my former employers' corporate typeface that initially triggered some PTSD. ) The exams are open notes, so the quality of your own notes is very important if you want to do well on the exam. I still had to go back and watch lectures for a few questions, but having structured notes made it easy to quickly find that specific lecture. \n\nEach week had individual assignments which usually take 3-4 hours if you want to do a good job and earn an A. There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course. Since user-centric design principles focus on receiving feedback to inform iteration and continuous improvement, it's no surprise he does the same for his courses.",

However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester. \n\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel. \n\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don't think it's necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used). \n\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that's all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project. You basically *have* to take a play project, and use your fellow students as the users. \n\nBBTW I seem to be writing about a different course than the people below, perhaps the assignments were reworked?",

I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers.

            "text": "I took the summer version of this class so it didn't have the extra credit options. \n\nSKILLS NEEDED: some C and assembler required for first project. For last project, its important you understand HTML, HTML forms and some PHP. Not having that general understanding seemed to be a barrier for some taking the class. \n\nThis class gives you a good broad overview of Information Security. It doesn't go too deeply into things. But the assignments are very well designed. The first one was challenging for me (even though I have lots of C and some Assembly experience). \n\nThe lectures cover a LOT and there's a lot of reading as well. So it was a bit challenging to just keep up with it in a busy schedule (esp. after having taken several lecture-light courses). The quizzes do a good job of keeping you on track in the schedule and on getting a summary of what is learned. \n\nThe TAs and professor have plenty of office hours but its mostly drop in or by arrangement. So I didn't really take advantage of this. \n\nIn terms of teaching I give this class full marks. \n\nMy only complaint is having to deal with strange wording issues in the Quizzes and Exams (as others have pointed out here). Generally such things don't bother me, but in this case it was more trying to figure out how the grader will respond than what the correct answer was. That needs improvement.",

Be ready to be challenged on programming projects as you will need to use data structures extensively, when implementing different phases of compilers.

The course covers all compilers phases. Lectures are crystal clear. Professor has been very committed to the office hours (weekly), open to different types of question. TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended.",

Point of perspective, the whole Deep Mind / Alpha Go think is built on top of the content of (RL). In general though, there is no teaching and it's more like a sink or swim class, more like you are generally expected to know the content up front (90%) and the remaining should be easily learnable. I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all. I made it, but the way the course is structured made it a lot more difficult than it should be. \n\nNegatives:\nToo many lecture readings per week. Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down. Who really has time to watch 3+ hours of lectures a week. Streamline to 1-2 hours. \n\nPositives:\nTA hands on sessions are useful. \nProject's content are really interesting. \n\nIn general, the course has potential. The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none. HWs need to be revamped to intro to a project, example, a HW could be done on linear programming with probabilities as a trivial example as basically project 3 that's all it's about.",

Unfortunately, right now, I'm cramming facts for the exam (25 T/F with \"twitter style\" answer justifications). During the summer session you have something due every week, with 2 homeworks and 1 project released simultaneously every 3 weeks and I found myself not having much time to spend on anything else other than getting those done. I did the best I could to get the homework done as early as possible to maximize time spent on the projects. \n\nI disagree with criticisms of the TAs this summer. These guys were great, worked hard, and likely felt the pressure of the compressed schedule more than we did, especially since the profs were absent - the TAs completely ran the course (and did a pretty good job IMO). \n\nThe only ML background I had coming in was ML4T and I didn't feel that I needed any more than that as preparation. Its a good class, if you take it in the summer, know that it will be a lot of work.

Instead, it asks you to memorize concepts, protocols, and several shameless plugs from the instructor. \n\nDon't let the first few videos fool you with that hard yellow hat or the substation in the background into thinking the instructor is passionate about the class. On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss.

I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes. Even so, I would assume this would be a relatively light class, and could pair well with a more time-intensive class.",

The professor runs the lectures of the course nearly directly from a technical book, with his preferences emphasized. It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it's a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics. \n\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve. \n\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them. \n\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count. \n\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class. That probably speaks to the strength of OMSCS. It's not a BAD class, per se, but it does not stand up to many of the others. And that's a pretty high bar.",

The only reasons I'm giving two stars are because the material is interesting and because one of the TAs actually did make an effort to engage with the students. If you are looking for a class where you can have meaningful discussions and really dig into the material, definitely pass on this course for now. \n\nProfessor Lee never communicated with students a single time. When a project was shut down when students got emails from GA Tech Cyber Security telling them they were violating institute policy and potentially federal law, there was silence. When the final project was based around a paper he authored and questions were posted regarding both practical and theoretical application of the concepts, there was silence. The instructor could have been listed as \"Mickey Mouse\" and the student experience would have been the same. \n\nOther instructors were not much help either. If you have a question about something in a project writeup, be prepared to be told to re-read the writeup ad nauseum or to literally beg for clarification on Piazza and then get ignored. Expect cryptic or poorly-worded responses from instructors buried in random threads with no further clarifications provided, and private posts to go unresolved for entire project windows. One TA did hold weekly office hours and actively participated in Slack and Piazza, but it just wasn't enough. \n\nStudents were also limited in their ability to help each other, despite the lack of instructor participation. Trying to give hints or troubleshoot led to one occasion of instructors threatening students with honor code violations. Solutions to past projects were also deemed off-limits due to the fear of withdrawn students hiding on Piazza to learn the solutions. If you didn't figure it out yourself, too bad. \n\nStill on track for an A, though the 10% extra credit exam is no longer EC.",

The problem is that the course is a long, extensive enumeration of a bunch of things that you should memorize (snooze-triggering videos on the details of various protocols used in industrial control systems) and then the exams do a very poor job in measuring the extent to which you've absorbed that information. So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well. I just finished the final in less than three minutes, having settled on an end goal of getting over half of the T/F questions correct for a B (the A being unattainable or not worth it due to crap questions). The worst course I've taken in the program and could use some strong changes.",

Others had trouble getting the systems up/running, but I did not have that issue. \n\nThe other half of the grade for the course is tied up in hair-splitting true/false questions on two tests (both of which have a fairly limited number of questions). \n\nI think the course needs some work to take some slices of it deeper and give up on some of the broadness of the topics covered.",

            "text": "I would like to give this class a better rating because I really enjoyed the material and Dr. Thrun, and it fairly well organized in some ways. However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format. This is speculation, but given the expected 2 weeks to study in a normal semester, it would likely have felt a bit more manageable to review all of the content. \n\nOverall, I thought the course was worthwhile, but it is definitely not one to take lightly with regards to workload or effort required.",

On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade.

As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles. \n\n5. ) I learned nothing. I think the longest project took me 6 hours and the shortest about 2 hours and it would've been very easy to do each one without watching the lectures or reading the papers. \n\nThis class has great potential, but in its current form it's absolutely terrible. In hindsight, I wish I had taken anything else or nothing at all. Steer clear, if you can. If you can't, try to take this in the fall or spring. I feel like doing this over the summer semester made all of this class' shortcomings more obvious.",

I took 30+ and almost 40 hours for project 2 and project 3. You need run some jobs. and it may take a one day, sometimes two days. Also, you need better computer with GPU. Please buy a computer with GPU. It really helps a lots. \n\nAlso there are lots of papers need read. Some video I did not understand, I watched David Silver (youtube version RL Course by David Silver) or Andrew Ng (youtube version from lesson 16 to lesson 20) first. then watch video again. it helps a lot. But for summer, it was short time. and if you had full time job. I think you need sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 AM for paper and video. and get up at 7:00 AM for job from Monday to Friday. and no weekends, because you need finish your HWs or Projects every weeks. So i think no life if you plan to take this course at summer. BTW, TA is best. helpful and very great.",

            "text": "As others have mentioned, the workload was very high over the summer. I believe there were only 2 projects for Summer 2016 - we had 3 projects, 6 homeworks, and a final for Summer 2017. This meant something was due every week, with projects due every 3 weeks. \n\nI'd say this course in the summer is at least as much work as ML in a full semester, if not more. I wish I had taken it in a full semester, as even doubled up with another class I think the slower pace for the projects would have been extremely helpful. \n\nRegarding the course overall, I liked it, but not as much as I was expecting to. The lectures were great, the volume of expected readings was overwhelming, and I have mixed feelings about the projects. I really enjoyed the second project (Lunar Lander), where we used cutting-edge RL techniques to solve an OpenAI Gym problem. The first and third projects were both replicating results from papers, and I found I don't enjoy that very much. I think it's a valuable skill to have, but the emphasis was too heavy on it. My ideal would be to keep the first project as a paper replication project, but replace the third project with one similar to the second (where we read papers to learn the techniques and apply them to solve a challenging problem). I actually quite enjoyed the material the third project focused on. \n\nI also didn't really see the point of submitting both a 3-page paper and a 5-minute recorded presentation (with an exception for project 2, where it was neat to be able to show videos of my agent playing Lunar Lander). I think this is a common complaint, as the TAs polled the class on our preferred submission format, so I think this might change going forward. \n\nOne last thing, Dr. Isbell was almost completely absent from Piazza (I knew from reviews here to expect this, but it's a big departure from ML). The TA team was exceptional and did a great job of running the course, especially Miguel and Tim, but I wish Dr. Isbell was more active.",

The professor and TAs are good about making sure you know the expectations for the class, that you keep your scope for you project reasonable, and that you are roughly on track throughout the course. If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines.",

Another thing about those quizzes, the graded T-Square quizzes, and the final - they are all terribly worded and ambiguous. I did well on the projects and felt like I generally understood the material, but I was baffled at how to answer vague true/false questions on familiar topics. \n\nThe hardest part of the course was just figuring out what was expected for each project. Students would post to Piazza asking for clarification on the (extremely confusing and often incorrect) project writeups. Even when some of these issues got resolved, they weren't clearly communicated to the class with announcements, pinned posts, or changes to the project descriptions, so you basically had to comb through Piazza and find each of them individually. In this course's magnum opus of professor apathy leading to a half-baked assignment, he didn't get approval from OIT before having us do numerous port scans while connected to the school's VPN. This resulted in students being kicked from the network and unable to complete the original project. \n\nThe grading was also pretty bad. You could lose a ton of points by omitting \"www\" or mispelling a filename or text answer. This was compounded by the fact that the project descriptions were vague about the expected format of each file and answer, further compounded by the extreme rigidity of the autograder scripts.",

The videos, though high quality and well produced, seemed incomplete and poorly ordered. Video wise I learned much more from the freely available db classes on youtube (by stanford, peirce college, and houston clear lake). The exam questions were more tricky than than a test of knowledge (thus the difficulty rating). And no one in 2017 is going to need that much in depth knowledge about calculating index size. A unit on some of the new db trends (ie NoSQL), would have been time much better spent. Or maybe an actual case study of redesigning a problematic db application. \n\nThe class project is more about application programming than anything to do with db architecture and design. The db architecture and sql required were rudimentary imo. The programming, while not advanced, was extensive. Much larger than the db piece. Heaven help you if you get a bad team-- the group project will be a nightmare. Make sure everyone on your team has some level of programming experience. \n\nBEWARE the phase3 of the project. It's graded more about how you do the demo and programming than ANYTHING having to do with DB design and architecture. Even if your app is bullet proof be sure to conduct the demo in such a was as to go through the instructions ONE BY ONE calling out where your app meets the description. Don't count on the TA to ask you about anything you may have forgotten or been nervous and overlooked. \n\nAnd yes, as stated by the other reviewers, the class was tight and well run, the instructor (Jay) very attentive, knowledgeable, and responsive in piazza.",

The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking. \n\nIn addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor. It left students unable to complete the assignment, although they were given an alternative quiz afterwards it was very poorly handled. \n\nIn summary it is an interesting course and I did learn a lot from it, but the projects were very poorly handled in terms of incorrect instructions and ambiguities.",

The course material itself is interesting - If you don't know in detail how internet works and nothing about traffic engineering, security issues, what is a cluster etc this is a good course to learn. It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work",

Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers",

The content is interesting and timely, we were studying malware by the time wannaCry was released!, The assignments are not complex but some will challenge you and will ask you to think​ in more creative ways to achieve results. As constructive feedback, this class needs a better video format, it's basically the professor reading the slides, and make the auto-graders a little smart, you get a lot of deductions that will weight in your final grade, because of trivial problems like file names and spelling.",

            "text": "I'm pretty much echoing the other comments. This course is different than the typical OMSCS course (It was my 7th one, for basis of comparison). It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",

Having a basic understanding of python, network\\programming basics, and android development. \n\nMy expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen. After the course I would say some of these expectations were met. \n\nThe course feels like a great overview of some of the security vulnerabilities in the existing structure of networks and the internet. It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all. \n\nThe TAs lead this class completely, with one TA standing way above all the rest. And he wasn’t even the head TA.",

The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all.

I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them.

However they give you no training in creating a UI. If you don't have people on your team who have done this sort of thing before you are in for trouble. In the demo that you are required to give at the end of the phase there is no proper rubric as to what and how you are required to demonstrate. No complete guidelines. They give you something called a demo guidelines for phase 3. Even if you have it all working according to those guidelines you will have points deducted because some column is not sorted by date by default. I think the project should only test you on what is taught in the class. Not on how well you create a UI that interacts with your database. That is completely outside the scope of what is taught. This is the part that makes it hard. Otherwise the instructor was quick to respond to many things in piazza. The main TA Will regularly took part in office hours. The other TAs are invisible.",

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters.",

I worked with excellent individuals, and the 4 of us just automagically dove into our imagined roles and pounded out a project with a good score. Though there is a mechanism to adjust scoring should there be inequities in contribution from the other group partners (or so I've heard). \n\nBased on conversations with others, there were additional projects that are now in place where they weren't present previously in prior summer semesters.

You're working in teams, though, and despite their pleas to the contrary, that means you're practically only going to get hands-on experience with some of this. \n\nThe exams, are - to me - a bummer. They account for 50% of the total grade. They are 25 questions each, which means your margin for error is slim. And aggravatingly, each contained one or two trick questions that were intended to catch you on some technicality or wording instead of testing your knowledge. I spent probably 20-25 hours studying for each and did not do well on one of them. I've been using SQL databases in my job for nearly 20 years, so this was a pretty befuddling result. \n\nIn all, I think the class is in the lower half of the pack for OMSCS.

Best part was each of those important papers were precisely explained in Udacity videos except Professor's dialect :) I listened to the videos and read the papers. Quizzes require reading. Projects were really awesome. I did all the projects very well. I was able to relate the practical aspect of the Network Security via projects. One project was really challenging one. I had to scan the whole world wide Internet using university supported infrastructure and processes. The last project was really cool. I had to read the research paper and implement the python code to evade the Intrusion detection itself. I also got good reading material for Bit coins. On down side, auto grading kept me in tension till l last minute.. Also, many fellow students were appeared to be super smart. They were also very helpful. I needed to be on Piazza & Slack up to date. At the end, I realized, Security was really mindset. Overall, TAs helped me to complete the course successfully.

Might be just me, but I felt like the test were trickier, basically not doing as well on the test as I thought I did when I took the test. Make sure you know C or have done some C programming before you take this class, there are MANY people who drop out during the first project just for this reason of thinking they will learn on the fly and are not able to keep up. From the perspective of someone with a undergrad CS degree (obviously this will vary based on your undergrad CS program rigor) everything up to about a little after mid term I already had familiarity with or forgot (Obviously the class went in greater depth of the topics I already covered in undergrad so I learn't new stuff here and there in the first half of the content). On the second part of the semester is where It covers virtualization and distributed systems, RPC and was where I really saw new content for me personally. If I took this during the longer semester I probably would have rated this class a medium difficultly based on my background. \n\nLike I said prior, unless you are pretty good in C, the projects will consume A LOT of your time and the test seemed tricky or maybe for the summer I was just a bad test taker..

No projected deadline for, say, feedback, was even close to adhered to.

I'm fighting to get the grades uploaded, and they've been out for about 5 minutes, and you can't wait for me to finish before you start asking questions?\" That sort of emotional outburst and unprofessional behavior was common. People quickly stopped using Piazza for most questions, to avoid exposing themselves to that sort of thing. \n\nThis course was poorly-planned, poorly run, poorly organized, and had a significant focus on irrelevant material (thank goodness someone on our team knew PHP, that old mainstay of database design).

But, I spent most of that time time reading suggested materials as much as I could.

Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics). \n\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course. \n\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own.

I am also an amateur photographer and very comfortable with a DSLR camera. This course comes with a weekly assignment which is to be turned in every Monday leaving very little breathing space. As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon. Good luck!",

I think this course could serve as a good introduction to C as well as operating system fundamentals, and it's not that hard to get an A despite not having experience with C. \nMy background - technical undergraduate degree (non-CS, a little programming), web developer for 3 years using higher-level languages, and read 'The C Programming Language' as I was starting the course. \nExperience with the course - this course requires a decent time commitment, both for projects and for keeping up with lectures. Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend).",

Once the second project started things changed, probably 20-30 hours a week for the rest of the semester. The second project hadn't been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n1) Write a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\n2) Experiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five. \n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the \"intro\" video for the quiz. \n\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\n\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score.

The assignments took me like 20-30 hours each (spread through 2 weeks, a workload of 15 hours/week). \n\nOn the other hand I can see how for someone with no experience AT ALL in the skills mentioned above, this class could take as much as 30-40 hours/week. \n\nSome people have mentioned \"you HAVE to LEARN Pig/Hbase/Hive\". I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient.

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting.",

While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course). \n\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects. Hoping that GaTech addresses this disparity going forward to make sure the assignments and lectures converge a bit better.",

Very little participation by Prof Isbell, but the TAs were incredibly enthusiastic, involved, and had considerable knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe videos are well done. They're a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn't your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense. \n\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there's a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don't think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn't explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you're taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project. \n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don't really have pedagogical value. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something.",

This class provided a good introduction to machine learning while still making the projects challenging enough for someone in my position to appreciate. \n\nMy biggest complaint with this class has to do with the fact that I took it over the summer. I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so.

Great content, unbalanced projects requiring deeper dives outside of lecture materials--and time requirement exponentially growing in latter projects. Could have been way better managed--really wanted to love this class. \n\nGreat content, generous of Dr. Thrun for the two office hours, valiant attempt by a single TA running the class. Failed to impart any real understanding beyond the pre-packaged video content due to fear of releasing any real help (or content for future sessions) by openly discussing the problem both before or after the fact. Missed learning opportunity. \n\nAgain, the TA being overtly secretive about revealing approaches (not their fault) to the solutions produced the wrong kind of struggle for students. (Vastly different from ML4T, CP or CV--where you're guided to spend time focused on the right problems. ) And prevented forming a deep understanding of the mechanics of the concepts presented. Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems—hence you’re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken. \n\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn’t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code. To be fair, the generous curve at the end provided some relief but overall, it was pretty stressful (in the wrong way).",

            "text": "This first summer AI section was rough. Cramming a dense 16 week course into 12 weeks without omitting anything was ambitious. But then Dr. Starner was on sabbatical at Google all summer (working on Google Glass). So, our head instructor was one of Dr. Starner's Ph. D. students, and he hadn't been involved with an OMSCS course before. That led to some issues that I'd never experienced or heard of in other OMSCS courses. \n \nThe good news is that I learned a lot. The R&N textbook is good. There were 6 fun and instructive programming projects. Each had an autograder with a submission cap (e. g., 1/hr or 20 total). I averaged 20 hr/project and got to 100 on 5 of the 6 projects. On project 3 (Bayes Networks), I only got to 85 after 37 hours and 20 submissions. Thankfully, we got to drop our lowest project grade. \n \nThe videos were from three different people and had dramatically different quality. Thad Starner's videos were great - professional and easy to follow. Peter Norvig's videos were ok - made with home video but with good explanations. Sebastian Thrun's videos were terrible - made with home video and with awful explanations. Thrun's videos covered some of the hardest topics (e. g., Bayes Networks), so they were a big disappointment. \n \nThe midterm and final exams were take-home, and they were good learning tools. They made me dig into several areas deeper. Each exam required a lot of TA clarifications on Piazza, but the TAs graded the tests fairly trying to take all the clarifications into account. The TAs were cool about regrade requests too if you could justify why you needed one. \n \nI averaged 22 hours per week and had an A before the curve. My only prior Python use was in the CN course (CS 6250), so I didn't know Numpy. This course takes hard work, but I strongly recommend that you only take it during a full semester when Dr. Starner is available to manage the course. I finished less interested in AI & ML than when I started.",

You write a lot of docs, code the project, then backfill your docs with what really happened. You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class. \n\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar. Get ready to fight it out with your bosses and spouses. This course has no respect for your school/work/life balance, and throws many obstacles in your way. Much harder courses strike the balance, why can't this?",

If I had more time I would have liked to read all the material but given that the summer class is shorter with the same amount of content covered in the class, and that I was travelling during some of the class I didn't have time to do everything. \n\nOne thing I really appreciated about this class is that it also had a Machine Learning section and project that has now piqued my interest in ML! Before taking this class I had no real exposure to ML and now I'll probably wind up taking the official ML class. \n\nGrading feedback could have been a lot better / faster.

The projects I enjoyed the most were the Game Playing Agent, and Tri-directional search. \n\nI liked the exams and their \"open book\" format, I think they successfully covered important material, and conducted me to learn and reinforce the theory. \n\nAs others have mentioned, there were some (sometimes many) kinks and bugs in assignments and exams, but instructors were fair with respect to that (we got an extension due to some unclear instruction for some assignment, and we also got free bonus points for a couple of ambiguous exam questions). \n\nI only wish I had taken this class before other classes like ML, RL, but I guess then it would have taken me like 1. 5x the time.

Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs. \n\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school. \n\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest.",

I thought this course was not hard even though it was offered in the summer for the first time. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are not difficult to comprehend. I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam. \n\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don't start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved. \n\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct. \n\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great. In spite of being the first summer offer, they handled the challenge well and were able to solve most issues. There were some problems with the final grading but my impression is that they eventually got resolved. \n\nI managed to get a 96% before the curve. They use the median to determine your letter grade: A = if you are above min(90%, median(final grades)).",

The professor has only made 3 very minor appearances on Piazza, only one TA is active, and the lectures are short and have almost nothing to do with the course content. Everything that I've learned has been through self-learning, which 1) is not a very efficient way to learn a large amount of new material as I find myself constantly reinventing the wheel and 2) I can do this for free on my own time, focusing on exactly what I'm interested in. The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped. If you actually work in this area or want to work in this area, the course might be worth it since it forces you to use a lot of different technologies, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou'll learn a lot in this class like the other reviews state, but it's because you'll spend almost as much time on it as you do at your full time job, not because it's actually a good class.

There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren't designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn't a complaint, that's the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this. If something isn't compatible with the auto-grader, or there was a simple typo in a commit hash, function name, etc., then expect to receive zero points for that portion of the assignment, with no real wiggle room!",

The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course.",

While there are mostly no proofs involved (at least for the first 2/3 of the class), there is still a ton of material and concepts. The math isn't terrible, and everything you forgot is re-hashed by Dr. Vigoda so you can get back up to speed (although for graphs you will want to do a refresher on your own; otherwise this isnt needed). \n\nTo prep: I suggest going to the course website https://8803ga. wordpress. com/ and watching at least the first 2/3 of the lectures (the professor links to the videos on this page). I'd particularly suggest getting re-acquainted with asymptotic notation, the basics of graphs (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and basic graph terms are either lightly covered or not covered, depending, but you will need to know them), Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, and P/NP/NP-Complete before you take the course. I would suggest being able to at least hold a light conversation in all of these topics; with no exposure to these, 80-100 hours spent on them before the class will surely pay off. \n\nThe class is do-able, but be willing to prep OR be willing to spend 40 hour weeks on the course.",

While the previous class required a lot of proofs, this class requires informal proofs and pseudo-code. The book is definitely required, and I recommend also getting CLRS for the graphing section.

The homework, tests and project are all well constructed, fairly graded, and directly inline with the content covered in the course materials. However, it is not a simple regurgitation of the materials. It is an application of the materials and so you really have to understand and practice the use of the materials (the algorithms mostly) in solving problems because you will have to be able to apply them to other situations on the tests. \n\nThe grading is heavily weighted towards tests with 85% of the grade coming from tests (10% from project and 5% from homework). \n\nHomework, while it has little impact on the grade is a must-do. In fact, to succeed in the class I would say that you have to go out and find other homework from other courses and do those problems as well. \n\nThe project was a coding assignment which was interesting but not too challenging once you wrapped your head around it. They have indicated that they may add an additional coding project in a future iteration of the course, but don't plan on reducing the grading focus on exams. \n\nThis class has probably had the greatest participation in Piazza of both the instructor and the TA staff of any of the courses I have been in and that has been very helpful in understanding some of the nuances around the algorithms and their application. \n\nOverall a great class.",

Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.",

In other words, I spent more time trying to come up with interfaces to write about than time learning the material. My feelings towards this might stem from the fact that I am a coder at heart and there were not any assignments that leveraged that. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a lot of brainstorming about different interfaces and writing about redesigns for them, then this class is great.

There is so much content you have to cover in this class that if you don't prepare in advance (as in, before the semester starts) you will never catch up. Grades are heavily reliant on closed book exams, and mistakes are heavily penalized. (Sure there's partial credit, but you only really get partial credit if your answer is mostly correct. ) You have to know the material well enough to teach it to someone else. One positive is that there is no standard grading scale for this class. After the first exam, the professor said that anyone at the median or higher was at a B. This view of the grading means that half of the class is looking at below a B. I mention all of this not to complain, because I think the content is important, but to let you know that you should be studying. If you are on this page looking at reviews, stop. Go study dynamic programming, max flow, and NP. Go study now so that when the class starts you won't be behind.",

Great TAs and documentation make a huge difference in the quality of a class.

My favorite parts were learning about the original design principles of the internet (since it was a department of defense project), and how TCP flows and congestion control work. I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended. If you're a solid programmer, this is a good first course to take.",

I am actually not sure if I even get B in the end. \n\nThe midterm was brutal. I hardly got 57. Make sure you set aside a lots of time for that. I expect final and exams to be even harder. \n\nI liked the fact that we were given two weeks for assignments. It gave at least some breathing room. \n\nThe course was very well organized. TAs were very helpful and responsive. \nI love that the course makes me think and create, overcome challenges and grow.",

The quizzes were very helpful as study aids for the exams, but when combined with the lectures, readings, and assignments I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the amount of material. I learned a lot though, so it was worth the effort. They use an autograder system called Bonnie. I like Bonnie because it gives students feedback on their progress, so when you send in your final submission you should know what score you're going to get. All code is written in Python.",

There are only 4 assignments so you have several weeks to do each, but each one covers broad regions of the ML landscape. Part of the difficulty of each assignment is figuring out what is most important to include in your writeup. This seems to be deliberate. Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester). This course offers a broad view of the ML landscape and helps you learn how to approach ML topics so you can identify areas of interest and continue to build your skills beyond this course.",

We didn't hear much at all from the Professor in Piazza or other forums but the TA's had everything under control. I was very impressed by the level of organization. The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I'm not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you'll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project). Honestly some might be able to get by with 10 or 15 hours per week but if you want to learn this stuff, be prepared to set aside the time.",

A few students expressed concerns about grading consistency with the first two homework assignments, but regrades are underway. The current construction has one homework that is machine learning heavy and that has been the source of the most complaints on Piazza. As with ML4T the topics are introduced in lecture, but possibly not in sufficient depth for someone without recent undergraduate background in CS theory and math (partial derivatives of vectors). Both ML4T and DVA include machine learning topics along with domain topics (pandas, stocks and R, visualization respectively).

At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday!",

I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

You should get both BOOK s, do further research on the internet, do the supplimental exercises, participate in Piazza, go to office hours, join a study group, etc. But most importantly, just stick it out.

As others have noted, the class does have 2 distinct parts. The first part is theoretical, and the second part dives into some pretty heavy topics with algorithm analysis. I actually found the first half of the class easier to understand just because of the shear volume of information in the second part. As far as time commitment, you have 8 assignments due roughly every 2 weeks, and each assignment took me ~10 hours or so. Add in time for going through the lectures and studying/preparing for the tests. Grading is very fair. I really like Charles as an instructor and a TA, and he is very involved and approachable.

The first half of the course is mostly theoritical and time-consuming, while the second half was quite easy but requires math. The lectures touch upon the concepts but for assignments and home works, there's a good amount of study required. Mere lectures wont be enough. Python was easy to pick up along the class. The best resource was Piazza forum - maximizes your understanding and lots of help. The homeworks are a great way to learn and mostly tailor along the recommended BOOK s - so that was quite a relief! Don't take the course lightly - it is demanding and start your homeworks early. There was always a homework every two weeks. And I found the exams tougher than regular assignments. Nonetheless, I loved the content of the course. ",

So, office hours are not very helpful. \nProf and some TAs are 'sensitive' to the discourse among the students. So, when people expressed too many conserns with the course, professor responded with the warnings about plagiarizm in homeworks and actually lowered the grades of several students. That worked, and no one complained much sinse. \nPiazza messaging was very active, but mostly from those who were 'lost'. Those who could be helpful did not really try to help because they were afraid to break 'code of conduct' by giving too much help, and also because of the curve (if others fail, your grade goes up).

There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.

(The majority of the students are probably older, and likely more experienced than the TAs, so that's a factor to consider. ) The quiz questions and answers are sometimes very cryptic, and some of the course communications aren't always written in proper English. Some of the quiz text appears to be plagiarized from other sources because the content is not covered in readings or lectures. I have printed the quiz out and kept it handy while watching lectures which basically makes it easy to ace most of the questions. The TAs are also sticklers for following the directions, but we had the same issue in CS6300... some people just don't follow directions. I am mostly satisfied, though, because these issues have not gotten in the way of my learning, and I have a pretty decent understanding of Python so the assignments are not that challenging. ",

The lectures have continued to be good, but the rest of the class experience has been a disappointment. I feel for the TAs - it seems like there has been ZERO involvement from the professor of record now that he's moved on to Princeton. The TAs are left holding the bag, and things have been very disorganized as a result. The programming assignments are almost laughably easy (I completed most in less than an hour), but the multiple-choice quizzes take a ridiculous amount of time. A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures. This is my first semester in the program, and I would have been really disappointed and questioning the caliber of the program if I weren't taking CS6300 concurrently. ",

Students obsessed over these details since the autograder scripts apparently cannot accept filenames with even the slightest variation (no wildcard characters??).

The faculty of Georgia Tech provided no communication about this course's professor or his absence. There was no attempt to repair the course that clearly got off to a rough start.

On the positive side, in the first part of the course, the lectures provide a good graduate level introduction to networking. The rest of the course deals mostly with Software Defined Networking. Here, the lectures are ok. But the 'lab' part of the assignments really need to be reworked-they are not challenging and often involved mindlessly following step by step instructions. Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors. TAs were slow to return quizes and there was a 'negotiation' on piazza after a quiz was graded, and then the quizes were regraded. With some exceptions, Piazza discussions were not great and TA responses were often no more than a couple of words. ",

You had to watch Piazza pretty closely to keep tabs on the various quiz questions for that week. Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.

There are 2 assignments that took > 10 hrs to complete. They were difficult because we had to use POX and Pyretic which had very little documentation. They give you an expected solution to match and most of the time, you should be able to reach it. There are quizzes and they do take time to get right. They are not trivial, it requires reading, looking up stuff online and researching to get correctly. Course lectures ARE NOT ENOUGH. While the class is not mathematically intense or technically complex, you get a solid understanding of the concepts and material. Piazza was communication was a disaster, and assignments were changed often.

The programming assignments usually amounted to 2-10 lines of code but always was a challenge due to subtleties in syntax. If you're looking to get an A with very little effort, this is it.

The assignments are horribly designed and not well tested before deployment. The quiz questions are ambigous, causing a lot of frustration. The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need. ",

This was by far the most interesting part of the course for me and it really hammered home all of the layers beneath Pyretic that we just kind of gloss over in the Georgia Tech course. It also gave a whole bunch of extra progamming assignments and exposure to some newer technologies that improve upon Pyretic or expand its capabilities. Overall, the course is far too easy on its own, but the material itself is very interesting and if you dig a little deeper and do some extra work on your own, you can still get just as much out of it as you get out of the more stand-alone challenging courses. Do the mininet and OpenFlow and Pyretic tutorials on each project's website and understand what these technologies are doing, ahead of when it comes up in the course. ",

There is a lot of studying of outside sources, not just the recommended readings, but whatever you can find on the algorithms you need to implement. They're not at all easy and you get very little credit for implementing them correctly. You'll spend a great deal of time just getting correct code, but you're graded mostly on performance, so keep that in mind. You need to pass the Udacity grader early, so you have plenty of time left to optimize and test your performance on the cluster. \n\nYou absolutely need to already know C, C++, and ideally at least a little about how OpenMP and OpenMPI work, or it's just going to get worse trying to learn that as you go. Know how to use common debugging and program analysis tools as well, gdb, valgrind, etc. You'll spend most of your time debugging early on when you're just trying to make sure the code works. \n\nFinally, know that it's not at all impossible to do well. I had trouble and had to drop because I was taking two other classes at the same time (including ML, which has very in-depth assignments) and was going through personal difficulties and just didn't have the time for it. If I had the time, I'm sure I'd have done fine. Just don't take the class lightly. You need to get an early start on every lab, do all the readings plus whatever other readings you can find, and get your code working early. I wish I'd known ahead of time we'd get almost nothing for correctness and be graded mostly on performance, which I guess makes sense in retrospect, but just wasn't what I was expecting based on all the other courses I've taken.

The projects are definitely difficult as I spend most of my time just trying to get the algorithm working without consideration for efficiency, but so far I have done well.

The problem is the amount of time required and the lack of transparency in the grading. I had never not completed a CS assignment before (high school, undergrad) but I just could not get one of the labs working, even after 40 hours. There is effectively little credit for completion and none for effort though the target performance is usually doable if you've gotten that far. Just keep in mind that, even if you sink many hours into a lab, if you don't get it working, you will fail\n\nThe midterm was very challenging, with a median grade of ~40%, but there was a +40% curve added which made it more reasonable. \n\nFinally, if you are not comfortable with C/C++, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.

It is the compliation of decades of very clever ideas, all rolled up into a short class. The lectures are well laid out and I was able to watch them at 1. 25x or 1. 5x the speed, depending on whether or not Milos had his coffee before he recorded the session. I enjoyed the coding sessions and I think that the changes we were required to make are close to what you might see in the real world if you were modifying internal simulation software. The most difficult aspect is that there is little guidance as to whether or not the metrics that you find in your projects are the optimal solution. This simulates the real world, where you have to make sure that what you code isn't outputting crap numbers, but makes it difficult to ensure that you get a good grade on every assignment, especially those where you are competing against the other students. Not for the feignt of heart, but a good class full of pretty cool information. ",

It helps if you are already familiar with processor architecture at a high-level (you should have heard the terms pipeline, register, ALU, cache, etc, and have an idea of what they are). You should have encountered MIPS assembly language for the discussions, but you won't need to do any MIPS programming - you just need to understand what the arguments and commands look like and you should be able to pick it up from there. The four assignments (2 individual, 2 with optional partners) will require C++ knowledge, and a VM environment to run the linux VM that contains the simulator (VMWare is recommended). \nI think the class started with something like 160 students, and at last count had around 100 on the roster; although the professor indicated something like 50-60 students turned in the latest assignment, so maybe quite a few more have dropped.

Poor responsiveness on Piazza, with a week or more going by without any instructor or TA presence. Absurd grading... one assignment had us submit (among other things) a 'Hello World' program with a modification to include our name. I forgot to submit that one (partly because the way the assignments are written makes it tricky to pull out what's needed for a submission) and got docked 30% of the whole grade. The course makes use of the SESC simulator, which is one of the worst, most poorly documented codebases I've ever seen. In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying. I never understood how wading through SESC to figure out how to change the branch predictor had any relevance to what a real processor does. Finally, the exams were a disaster. They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn't use anything on your computer. You had to do everything by hand on paper (like when doing the incredibly tedious cycle counting problems). This was a real problem in the test, because I hadn't done them that way... I always worked in OneNote to set up my tables, plug in my steps, etc. When I had to do it on paper on my desk, it was a complete mess. ",

The groups are 3-4 people each, and it can take more time than you expected due to the various concerns of your group members. You'll find that they approach things a bit differently than you do, so you may spend a fair amount of time just sorting that part out. A bit of real life thrown in!

For example our group worked very well, but many others complained in the forums about issues they were having where some team members were dead weight. Because of this your experience can vary greatly. You definetly need to know some Java going into this class. My knowledge was limmited to one class I took several years back, but was able to catch up quick by taking other online tutorials and READING BOOKs as I went and I Googled ALOT! The last project (originally scheduled to be a group project but changed after complaints about groups) was a solo project and very large. My project ended up being over 500 lines of code.

Overall the course felt disorganized and vague, most of the time I was not confident that I actually understood what was required and had to read a lot of forum posts for clarification, even on extremely simple busy work assignments. The most effort in the course is required during the group projects, which can include students anywhere on a spectrum from not being able to write code at all to having 10+ years of Java experience. A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute. I think I would only recommend this course to beginners who are confident that they can write Java code but do not have much software development experience beyond that. If you know absolutely nothing about concepts like source control, test coverage, and UML then you will learn a lot.

I think the class could have had much more material and be more rigorous. Since I have quite a bit of industry experience I don't think I got a whole lot of new knowledge. The assignments were simple the only problem being coordinating with your team. In the end some of the projects (like Project3) just seemed like busy work. I think it is a good class to get you warmed up for the harder classes in the program. The Piazza forum had some interesting discussions going because of the variety of student background in the subject matter.

The one hickup to this class is that your experience will depend heavily on what group you were placed into, as the second group project was somewhat complicated if you don't have prior Android and SQL experience.

I say this because some people complained about the content of the class. If you don't have prior experience with software development and Java programming, you may need to spend a lot more time. Also, there was an Android project which I think it wasn't too bad but some people complianed about the need to learn a lot of things in a short period of time.

For us, the guy with the Android experience and skills dropped out of the progam and this made it difficult for us to work on the team project.

Students should have to pass some coding pre-reqs to take this course because unprepared students are a huge burden on teammates; 'just' working on documents is no panacea because if they aren't involved with or don't understand the difficulty of implementing requirements, it hurts the entire team. There is zero involvement from TAs in managing group conflict, and no real authority structure to groups.

We spent a lot of time together, which was the hardest part, but we worked well together and I learned a lot about group work. Some weeks I spent very little time in this class.

NET knowledge over to Java, but it was easy to do so and the assignments are relatively basic. I would think that someone with zero programming experience would want to take a quick intro before jumping in, though. There were two group projects in this iteration of the class, which I'm normally not a fan of but they complemented this class nicely. Good simulation of working as part of a team in the real world. I felt like the way they handled grading the team vs. individual contributions was fair. I had a great group that had no problems working together, so I'm not sure how any serious conflicts within the team would be handled if the professor/TAs had to be involved. ",

I had a great experience with my group however I am aware that this was not the case universally. GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures. This is a great course to ease yourself into the OMSCS program. ",

The course instructor was one of the most engaging though which made it an alright experience. As others have commented the group work is awful, there is such a huge gap in experience and certain team members carry the lions share of the burden. I understand it's trying to represent 'real-world' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don't have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the 'project-manager' role for the project doesn't have an equitable share of the work.

The projects (45% of the grade) were physics-focused and we had to spend a lot of time dealing with those aspects of the project, which distracted from time to focus on the software architecture. The final exam covers the entire course, so do yourself a favor and prepare study questions as you go so you don't have to re-review and cram the week before finals!

Second, the projects need to be set up in a way that recognizes teams do not meet in person, and that teams are comprised of a wider variety of CS backgrounds than one would find on the on-campus program. People without programming experience can't contribute to the code, nor can they contribute much to documents that require understanding of the code.

The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome. This course is a lot of work, but I wouldn't steer clear of it. ",

Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments. \nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them. \nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting. \nWith some modifications, this can be a great course. ",

I scored nearly perfectly, but the Mid term grading upset a lot of people (1/4 of the questions were thrown out for being poorly written). It was probably one of the worst designed tests I've taken in terms of judging a student's grasp of the material. It's also hard to predict how well you will do, given that 50% of your grade is unknown until the final week of the course (a semester-long group project with VERY loose specifications). If you are interested in HIT and maybe a bit of an exploratory fun project, it's not bad.

There was also no real motivation to read all the suggested extra material. We were never tested on any of it. \n\n2) TEXT BOOK : I purchased the 'text BOOK ', which the professor DOES say is optional. It was VERY overpriced ($79. 95, even though the professor mistakenly says that students will be able to get the discounted price of $64. 95, which is STILL overpriced). For the price, it’s closer to the size of a PAMPHLET than a text BOOK !! I was very shocked when it came in the mail!\n\nDespite being overpriced, the lectures ARE based on the book content, so the book does indeed provide a solid foundation to the videos. It helped me a LITTLE with the midterm, but after the unfair/ambiguous/subjective questions on the midterm I probably would have done fine without the BOOK. \n\nDespite these kinks, I will say that Prof. Mark and TA Shan are very knowledgeable and responsive to concerns.

In this semester, there were no exams and in their place were a set of timed quizzes. The quizzes are open notes/lectures and follow the lecture content very closely, so for the most part the questions can be answered if the student watches and understands the lecture material. Most of the more challenging work in the course has to do with the semester-long group project, which involves creating a web application that uses heatlh data records. The very start of the semester and project was somewhat disorganized, because many changes were made at the last minute to switch from the previous version of the group project to a new group project involving FHIR web services. Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics. ",

No lectures really go all that in-depth on a particular subject though so it's more of a generalized view of informatics in the healthcare industry. There was a quiz every two weeks up until about 2/3 of the way through the course. At that point you're expected to work on the group project. The quizes questions for the most part were not very difficult if you paid attention to the lectures and used common sense; however, some of the questions were ambiguous at best and others downright confusing. \n\nWhat I found to be the most disappointing was the group project. Spring 2015 was the first semester they tried to use the GT FHIR server and it did not go well. Between the server constantly being under development, server connectivity problems, VPN problems, and a whole lot of other issues the project was a real pain for many groups. Our group decided fairly early on to abandon the GT FHIR server in favor of the more stable, public SPARK FHIR server and that turned out to be a good idea looking back on all the issues other groups were having. I felt our issues that we had to work through with our chosen server were relatively minor in comparison. \n\nGroup selection was an annoying issue with the course too. It look a couple weeks for everyone to find a group to join. The group I formed had a couple people express interest in joining only to find out they were apparently 'shopping' for the best group. The TAs sent out multiple requests trying to find groups for people to join as well. Also we didn't get to peer review our group members which was disappointing. The reason I say this class is Somewhat Easy is because the issues with the group project made it harder than it should have been. ",

The class could be run a bit better, but it is not all bad. I see lots of interaction on Piazza between the students and the TA's. Also, the professor does pop in the forum from time to time. I think the problems this class is experiencing stem from the fact that the prof is trying to keep the class up to date, so there is some churn in the material. Not a bad class at all. Assignments are spread out over the semester, so some weeks there is nothing to do (well, we are supposed to be working on our project). When there is an assigment, reading or otherwise takes a few hours in addition to the quizzes. This semester, we had one (1) try at taking each quiz. You do have to think/know the material to get it right. Oh, and be careful if you know healthcare already, because your definitions might not match those presented in the class and using your definitions on the quizzes will be counted wrong (this happened to several people).

The course is an exploration of education technology in whichever direction you wish to go in the space.

The course has a number of short essays due weekly that step you through the process of identifying an area of interest, reviewing existing research, and scoping a research project or development tool project for the remainder of the semester. The project is formalized with a Proposal that includes weekly milestones and some progress deliverables prior to the final completed project. Along the way, your progress is monitored by a single 'mentor' (TA) that is there to answer questions and ensure that your are on track, scoped correctly, etc. An important component of the class is participation, which includes giving and getting peer feedback along the way with each of the essays. The students are encouraged to participate in daily discussions on Piazza which follow a weekly pattern... 'What did you learn?', 'Q&A with ??', 'Let's discuss +/- of an existing OMS course', etc. The instructor is Dr. David Joyner, of KBAI fame, and he is extremely active on Piazza, keeping the class lively and engaged, which is no mean feat since we are all doing different projects. The final coursework is not done, so I can't comment here how it will all end, but so far it is a joy to be part of this particular environment. It is different from other courses.

The course started with an example that bordered on a magic trick, which definitely set the stage for it to be an engaging semester. The workload is moderate and consistent. There is ample room to go above and beyond on the projects if you have extra time, but you can usually squeak by on them without losing too much sleep.

Essa and the current TA (Daniel Castro) are both obviously interested in the material and encourage active Piazza discussion. The assignments test core material, but allow significant flexibility in the kinds of images chosen and always offer a section for explaining (inevitable) failures. Nothing but positive things to say about this course. PeerFeedback (. gatech. edu) is used well. I am both learning a lot and enjoying the class, which is about as good as you can get. ",

Prof Issa passionately explains the material, and provides helpful links to papers which study the materials in more details. Both he and TA Daniel Castro are available on Piazza daily. Assignments are very well explained, and reasonably difficult. Some of them are programming assignments using OpenCV+Python, some require you to take pictures and experiment with different camera parameters, and some combine both. At least in our class, forum participation is very active, with over 500 posts, sharing not only questions about the assignments but also results of our photographic creations and links to articles about latest advancements in computer vision and photography. Overall, great experience, and one of the best courses available. ",

Comes in handy on the assignments so I can go right back to the exact section where he talked about something. Since they want you to use your own pics, it invests me with more interest in the assignments. I think the assignments have been very clear, and really not that hard conceptually. Paying attention to what is asked and answered on piazza helps. This is the first time I ever coded in python, that cost me hours of learning the syntax. OpenCV has reasonable documentation, but it might not all apply to your version. So fun at 2am. It's really opened my eyes to what is possible with computers. we are writing our own code, or using open source, and it has generally had impressive results. Class piazza tips and help has been invaluable, and people have seemed to hit the right balance between enough help to move on, but not give away too much. reading the suggested papers has provided the answers to how to progress more than once. This has been a great intro to the program, fun to be challenged again. ",

Overall it is a fun course and one where you can learn many things (if you aren't already familiar with CV). ",

The instructor and TAs are awesome in conveying the material and responding to questions on the forums, though sadly, it appears that our current instructor Professor Bobick will no longer be actively in the forums in future semesters since he has accepted a new position. Grade is based on projects and a final exam. Projects are done in Python, MATLAB, or Octave, (your choice) so be sure you have a good handle on one of them (preferably not Octave, since you get MATLAB for free in Georgia Tech). An important thing in this class (and in any other) is to set enough time to watch the lectures and read the materials and do the homework. I've learned many times during this semester that I always need to take some breaks in order to 'get it' and go forward to the next step of the problem. So yeah, if you put aside the time, I think you should be fine. There is also a good amount of linear algebra, but I reckon it shouldn't be an issue if you've taken an undergraduate linear algebra/discrete mathematics course. ",

I have a minor exposure to linear algebra, and a strong exposure to calculus and I still found most of the math over my head. Some things that would be good to know ahead mathmatically: eigenvalues, gradients, sum of square differences, minor exposure to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, physic in motion and illumination, signal and frequencies, and of course the basic matrices and vector operations. The problem sets are the core of your grade and will vary in time commitment. I found ps1, ps4, ps5, ps6 to be the most time consuming having to work over 20 hours on each. The problem sets focused on creating the algorithms for the computation as well as modifying them to optimize your results, so it could get frustrating tweeking the inputs and variable of your algorithms. The professor of the lectures definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CV and a bit of his personality made the lectures very enganging. It's important to take notes for the lectures because at the end of the course there will be an exam and it is a pain have to go back through all the lectures as it was for me. The exam seemed fair. The instructor and TAs are helpful on piazza. And of course other students were very helpful. The office hours were helpful as well, I only had one problem with an office hour where I was the only student there and the TA was very unresponsive, but that was the exception to the rule. Take this course if you want to become interested in Computer Vision because you will once you take this course. The only thing I wish they had done for this course was post solutions to the problem sets after the deadlines. ",

You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks. ",

In addition, there are 8 written assignments which are fairly straightforward (“In 500 words, how would you apply technique X to the project”). One thing I have to emphasize is how much work the TAs and instructors are putting into building a community here - it feels a lot like being on campus due to the level and amount of discussion going on.

My advice is keep it simple. I would say it is a survey course in that you get an overview of lots of techniques and can choose what you want to do for your agent. Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate. In the early weeks, I think I spent more time on my agent just because I was a bit unsure but there have been weeks that I spent 5 hours on the class. Some of the lectures are an hour long so I'd dedicate at least 10 hours/week to the class, preferably closer to 15 just in case. ",

You do not need to have any previous AI experience to take this course, and it's not very math-heavy compared to other AI courses I have taken. You will also have a much easier time on the projects if you are proficient in writing Python or Java code, a lot of the project involves coming up with and trying your own ideas for algorithms so being able to implement a new idea quickly is helpful. If you do end up having a hard time on the projects, the minimum performance for getting a decent grade is very reasonable.

Therefore, most people stayed with brute force algorithmatic approach. Warning, if you never had image processing related experience, the visual compoenent will be more involved! Professor Goel and David are amazingly active in PIazza discussion and the TA's are responsive. 1 week turnaround on project/assignment. The final is fair, mostly concepts application and design. ",

That said, I feel like I didn't learn that much especially considering the amount of work I put in. Nothing was very difficult, but it was very time consuming. I'd venture that you could put in much less work and still do well. The programming projects are interesting, but become repetitive. As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a *ton* of writing for the class. I think I will hit 80 pages of turned in essays/design reports/exams. This semester there were 5 1000 word essays, 4 1500 word design reports, and 2 ~2500 word exams. However, I think you'd be hard pressed to cover the questions in the depth required by the rubric at those lengths; I was usually at least double the suggested length. Mostly these assignments are rehashing lecture material at a high level. I think this course would have been much better had they selected 3-4 topics and gone in depth on each with a tailored project. ",

One neat thing they do in this class is list and save exceptional submissions. Unlike the above comment, I thought this was a good introductory course for a broad amount of material.

Goel and Joyner are very serious about the course and very skilled at course management, meaning that you get a clear notion of what you ought to be doing to succeed, and how you are supposed to use the various tools (Piazza, lectures,... ) effectively. It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. \nIn terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.

I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)",

As mentioned above, research projects are very long reports, experiments take very long to run, and the assignments are the worst combination of loose-definition and high-expectation one could imagine.

Your code is worth zero points; your analysis is all that matters. So do not spend time writing code, spend it writing the analysis. They are very secretive about the midterm and final. The test format is like any other college test, but they are hard - you probably cannot get the right answers by intuition during the test, even if you are very familiar with the topics; the answers tend to require reasoning abstractly under time pressure (although less time pressure on the final). Exam grading is very coarse - as though it's done by the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, earning zero points for the slightest provocation. Everyone should take this course. ",

The assignments are flexible in terms of content, and very time-consuming, but the skills you will need to complete them can be learned during the course (you don't, for example, need to be a great programmer). The time-consuming aspect is usually learning how to do techniques needed for the assignment in Weka or another program, then actually running all of the experiments and collecting the data, before you can even start writing the 10+ page paper. If you try to procrastinate and wait until the last few days to start an assignment, you will not do well in this course. The exams are tough but fair, if you remember and understand everything from the lessons you should be able to answer everything without getting stuck, although the midterm was purpsosely designed to not give you enough time to complete it so don't waste too much time on any given question. I would say the one downside of this course is that it will take up too much time if you have commitments outside of this program and are taking another time-consuming course.

If you're the type of person that prefers paint-by-numbers type of assignments this class isn't for you. It is very open-ended and self-directed. The biggest challenge of the assignments is figuring out what to do as opposed to actually doing it. The lectures are great, but expect to supplement them heavily with the text BOOK and online research. Downsides: the instructor support in the forum was a bit scarce and/or untimely and the assignment grading was likewise untimely with limited feedback as the grading is based on a rigid rubric (which is hidden from you) that probably isn't ideal for such open-ended assignments. Also, the class felt very front-loaded to me as the last third was pretty quiet compared to the earlier enjoyable hell. The RL mini course doesn't tie in very well with the SL/UL stuff. ",

This included the MIT 7. 00x: Introduction to Biology and 7. QBWx Quantitative Biology Workshop. Prof. Isbell was active on Piazza answering all types of questions which I think is rare. So thank you for that. Though I do have some complaints listed below this is still the best OMSCS class I have taken so far. I expect to get kicked in the teeth for me to respect the class. I want to take the reinforcement learning class when it comes out though I will prepare for it in advance. \n\nBad - Will consume all time so don't take this course with another course. Some problem sets were assigned but solutions posted were incomplete. General lack of concrete problem examples/solutions. Needed to pull from old tests from other universities. \n\nUgly - Inconsistant grading of projects. Some received feedback of points off based on a rubric, some got only comments without telling where points where deducted and some got nothing at all. Felt some graders were tougher then others as I could tell several different grading styles. Either I had an easy grader for my third project or I got someone else's grade as it was my worst paper of the four but my highest grade. This will get worse as they may go to no feedback at all as the class size scales. You won't even know if your score is your own or a mistake. I think a few sentences describing where you got points deducted is a minimum requirement for a distance learning program for major assignments. ",

Looking things up that you know are on a video is hard to do, though.

The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren't really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say 'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don't get to see them in advance. This didn't impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn't specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless.

The assignments are very open ended, so open ended that it began to hurt my head on how I should proceed to do my assignments, I wanted them to be good, but at the same time reasonable to solve. (In retrospect I would go with making easier problems rather than flashier, more intricate problems). Basically, this was an excellent way to learn how to implement a machine learning problem in the practical sense. If the assignments are the practical side of ML, then the exams were the thereotical side. The midterm was hard, I couldn't even finish the whole test, this is expected so it is generously curved, they are also very lenient with grading it, so move fast on the midterm. I just finished the final and didn't find it to be as difficult as the midterm. I enjoyed both tests. And although the implementations of the algorithms were not required to be done for the course, the algorithms were given in class and left to the student to implement himself if he wanted to. I was not too fond of this at first, but realized that I learned more about the behavior of data and machine learning algorithms by seeing how they worked in a practical sense. If one wants to learn more indepth about how algorithms should be implemented look at the Coursera. com course on Machine Learning, which I also highly recommend. I am excited for the new reinforcement course taught by the same professors in the Fall. Its good to know Java and Python for this class. As I am sure the TA were quite backed up this semester, I was not happy with the grading system. Points on assignments seem to be taken off without much justification. ",

The lectures take so long to get to the point, they are quite shallow and we never see an application of the algorithms (I thought it was a strong point of the Andrew Ng's lectures). The assignments are painfully long and the grading is so frustratingly inconsistent. Most of the time a assignment requires to solve twice the same problem for no other reason than to take up your time. There is so much material covered that we learn everything to a very shallow level and the math that everybody seems to be scared about is never used during the assignments nor during the exams (which makes the math requirements quite low I think). This being said, I have learned so much during this class and that makes a very effective foundational class for the rest of the master. If the Machine learning specialization is the one you want, start by this class! I would even add that I would not have succeeded in the interview process I just went through without this class experience. ",

They link https://archive. ics. uci. edu/ml/datasets. html in the syllabus - you could also try http://mldata. org/ and https://bitly. com/bundles/bigmlcom/4. \nI used Weka, ABAGAIL, ABAGAIL and BURLAP respectively for the four assignments. Note that these required virtually no coding. They encourage you to do as little coding as possible for the assignments, and they are serious about this. Unfortunately, they had very specific grading criteria which they didn't share in advance of the assignment submission, particularly for the first one. It also took an insane amount of time to turn around the assignments - I got back assignment 1 on the day assignment 2 or 3 was due. Because of this it took me some time to even understand what they were looking for in the papers. \nOn the flip side, their final grades were quite forgiving, and if you had a good score on the final and the last assignment they erred on the side of giving you a higher mark.

For both material I had seen and not seen before, Prof. Isbell and Prof. Littman did a great job of presenting the ideas, intuition, and some degree of mathematical formalism. If only my classes in undergrad were so entertaining! Maybe there were a few things that I didn't know, such as algorithms and complexity, but nothing a little Googling couldn't solve. The lecture videos take maybe 4 hours a week, with some pausing. What really kills the brain is some of the REALLY long and mathematical reading. My advice: skim, but don't skip the reading. There's a lot of interesting details, not to mention having a broad view of the field of machine learning is quite useful if you want to practice data science. So you have to be efficient. (Read: Data science != Machine learning). \n\nThe tests were fair in my opinion. They did make me think hard about the properties of the methods we studied. But they are long. It's a bit annoying to use the text entry methods on T-Square, especially when Piazza was way better for typesetting math. \n\nProbably as many people will say, the homeworks were incredibly time consuming. On average, the homeworks took me about 40 hours. This includes brainstorming ideas, programming and implementation of algorithms, collecting data, generating graphs and tables, and writing the report. I admit that I'm a pretty slow (bad?) coder, but using Python made it easier. On the other hand, Python has fewer resources and is slower than Java. But that's the practical lesson of the homeworks: balancing speed of implemention, execution time, and effectiveness. Don't make your homework needlessly complicated though, since your goal should be to master the concepts, not programming!\n\nThe recommended book (by Tom Mitchell) was pretty accessible. It's not a criticism of the class, but I thought many of the examples IN THE book were lame or otherwise uninteresting. On the other hand, the chapter introductions and especially summaries were a great review. I would recommend also checking out a few other BOOK s in addition. \n\nLast comment: Piazza is awesome, especially if you are active. I didn't find Hipchat to be very useful since it was a bit too real-time and you couldn't typeset math when you needed to explain equations or what not. I didn't attend any of the office hours. ",

You need to choose what tool or software package to use (WEKA, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, R, SciKit, etc. ) as well as what algorithms and parameters to use in many cases. You are given very little direction on how to perform the expiriments, so they typically take a great deal of time to setup. You are given zero points for implementing the actual expiriment, the grade is based entirely on your analysis of your results.

Some suggestions: To students - 1) follow the assignment rubric carefully, if it says do kurtosis analysis - do it (it's actually not that optional as you might think). If you do a reasonable analysis following rubric fully, you can be almost sure you'll get more than 90% and all the rest will depend on the amount and quality of your analysis. 2) Do all optional work you are given (reviewing assignments, problem sets, etc. ) It will help understand the material and get a better grade. 3) If you want to really succeed on the exams (like solving almost all problems) and it is your 1st ML course, then doing lectures and homework assignments most probably won't be enough. Read the BOOK s and solve some additional problems from other sources. To Profs: 1) it would be great to make problem sets a little closer to the type of questions students will see on the exam (both questions and problems), I felt that they were slightly disconnected sometimes. 2) It would be better to provide more problems in each problem set (even if they are optional). 3) It would be good to see not only midterm exam explained by Profs, but also Final - it is a really important educational piece to know what you did right/wrong on the exam and why.

There were several plots they were looking for in each project that weren't obivous until grading, although by the last one you can start to guess what they're looking for. The exams were challenging. I do feel like I learned a lot, and somehow managed to get an A. The curve will be your friend.

Follow the clear instructions on each project and you'll do well on them. My math skills are a bit rusty, so I had to go back and do some refreshers on it. Some of the advanced math concepts for the algorithms were challenging, but not essential to understanding how to use the algorithms. The class was very rewarding and I recommend it, but you should plan sufficient time to keep up with the workload. If you fall behind, you would have a difficult time recovering. One other thing that is crucial to the class is the selection of datasets you use for your assignments. Picking a simple dataset won't let you contrast the algorithms, picking too large a dataset will make run-times for the projects extremely long. My recommendation is to find a good large dataset and pair the data down to something that runs in a reasonable time. Don't use small datasets with less than 1000 records. ",

            "text": "I'm somewhat echoing what Victor Ma said, as my perspective is of someone coming in with a pretty strong background in math modeling and statistics as well as statistical programming and data analysis. The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn't address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn't much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don't need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you're measuring. \n\nThe biggest thing is don't underestimate the assignments. Don't get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn't the class for it. You'll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It's specific to the problem you're trying to solve and this isn't covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study. The package documentation for modeling software usually explains these things pretty well and it isn't complicated, but you'll lose points if you just use straight defaults across the board and can't justify why you chose the resampling technique, parameter tuning strategy, and performance measures you chose.

It's very, very easy, covering the very basics of portfolio management but only including long and short equity positions, nothing on derivatives, fixed income, FX. If you've used NumPy and pandas before, you can basically sleep through the first month of the course. I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on.

This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.

The lectures are structured to take full advantage of the Udactity integrated python enviroment. This makes it easy to make incremental advances in your understanding of the topics. I wish they covered a few more ways to apply the different types of filters. Each filter is explained in a particular context and without experience in the field it's difficult to see how it could be applied in another situation.

Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\n\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class?",

Just study kalman filter (search the web for more accessible tutorial) and you'll do fine. The optional extra credit is tough (lots of noise). The final group project is a hit or miss. It can be tough if you have bad teammates who dont contribute or MIA. But it's very much doable by one person. You need to research on technique outside of what is taught in the lecture.

The other part of the course that is nice is the final project and optional hardware challenges allow you the chance to try to apply the concepts to real systems.

Professor Thrun keeps the lectures interesting and shows great enthusiasm for the topic. \n\nUltimately though I didn't feel like I got what I wanted out of the course. The connection to robotics was superficial, all of the code is in Python with no hardware required. The algorithms taught are used in robotcs but I didn't feel like we went in depth enough into them that I can comfortably remember how to use them without looking them up again. The class could honestly use a required hardware component (rather than extra credit as it is now) to flush out the classes connection to robotics. \n\nIt has a group project component worth 40% of your grade.

Even though the final project was a group project, I was able to program the primary working code we chose to use in a couple nights and a Saturday. Ironically, the final allowed for algorithms not covered in class.

            "text": "I highly recommend this class. The concepts are logically laid out, the lectures are easily digestible, and the support from the Professor and TA's are well above average. The midterm content was no surprise but it was challenging. The projects are easily the biggest time investment. Based on voluntary polls I conducted on G+ students reported spending on average about 40 hours on project one and three, and about 5 hours on average on project 2 and 4. There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself. There is no need to turn in production quality code. ",

This class gives you a broad understanding about linux OS but does get into detailed discussions about multithreading and multiprocessor systems. I do agree with others here that the project descriptions are not very well defined but the office hours really helped in better understanding of what was required. Piazza was exploding with information and discussions with high level of participation from students, TAs and professor Ada. Infact I believe it was piazza discussions that really helped me with the projects. Knowing atleast a bit of C, functions and pointers in C and creating a robust linked list program prior to the course will be very useful. The linked list that I created for project 1, I reused it for project 3. The classes were very well organized and lots of effort and thought has been put into organizing this class. Really very rewarding and a blissful experience. This is my first semester and I really hope the remaining OMSCS is atleast or better than this class in terms of class organization. ",

I often fell behind on lectures due the amount of time working on projects, and couldn't have imagined taking IOS alongside another class (while working).

They are responsive on the forums, encouraging when students are in panic mode, and patiently responsive to criticism of content / organization. Really impressed with them. The relationship has felt surprisingly personal. Hopefully that persists beyond their first semester. \n\nThe projects can be very time consuming. I echo that you need to know C. Some specific C skills you'll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\n\n - string manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\n - use of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\n - general memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you've only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\n - file I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek) \n - using proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\n - creating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\n - creating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\n\nYou're expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don't really need any special libraries. \n\nThere's also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you'll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I'd recommend that if you're a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there's a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions. \n\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you'll be fine. You'll just learn how much you take for granted. :) \n\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle. The lectures aren't terribly long, they build on each other well, and (bonus!) they include a lot of fun graphics. I had no former exposure to most of the lesson topics, and I found the majority of the material very accessible. \n\nOh! A lot of people used valgrind and gdb for debugging, as well. ",

However, the projects are extremely frustrating. A lot of people think that it's due to C programming. But I don't think so. They're frustrating because they're contrived to be difficult. The instructor has only one solution in mind. But they don't provide you any guidelines. And then you have to spend endless hours trying to figure out what they had in mind. Obviously there are so many other ways to solve the problem. But you're constrained to figure out what to do with the terse and convoluted code skeleton provided without much explanation. And then there's the whole mess of the autograder which only works with the solution they had in mind. Other working solutions might fail the autograder with mysterious messages. The TA's would never acknowledge the problems with the autograder and would always blame it back on the student. The only help they provide is very genericand doesn't help much. At the end of all of it, you're not given any solution guidelines. So you don't really learn what you did wrong and how you could improve. I have professional experience using C for a couple years. C is not the problem. I have a job that requires no more than 40 hours a week. But at the job I have to be intense and sharp. This course has definitely affected my job. All these hours of frustrating project work got to me and it was interfering with my work. I'm not sure I would recommend taking this course if you're full-time employed. I definitely learned a few things. But was it worth all the effort and frustration? I'm not sure",

Regarding the projects I think there were a few misconceptions - firstly I don't think that C is a massive hurdle here that it is percevied to be. I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are. The marks that I lost in assignments were in hindsight I think due to not thinking more about testing. The problem here is that you will clock a lot of hours. At some point I just had to say enough and move on. ",

Everything else is explained in the lectures. Projects 1 and 3 are large and complicated and will require a lot of time -- especially if you have to try to learn C at the same time. I would highly recommend starting the projects as soon as they are available to make sure you have enough time to finish them (and try to get it through the autograder). The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don't really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you've passed the autograder you can be confident that you've done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few 'build-up' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn't find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together. Although, I'm not a programmer, so perhaps having some 'embedded direction' is more helpful to me than someone who has a lot more experience. ",

Instructor and TA's participation on Piazza is minimal and limited to administrative issues, if any. Lectures themselves, created by original instructor are very informative and actually entertaining. There is a lot of material to cover, and assignments are time consuming and difficult to implement, since most of time, results are vary from run to run. There are several changes coming with new instructor: all assignments are to be implemented in OpenCV Python, although examples in the lectures are in Matlab. Grades are \"artificially suppressed\" - 100%=90%\nWork is front loaded - there are four assignments coming every week in the first month or so. It is actually good part, so you can drop a class early, if it does not work out. I came with Matlab experience and mandatory use of OpenCV came as a surprise, although Python with numpy, scipy and OpenCV packages turned out quite Matlab-ish. I am glad, I stayed. Classmates are great and there is a lot of help to be found on Piazza, actually I am learning the most from my classmates. ",

The assignments got a bit tedious- 20 assignments in the semester administered as quizzes on T-square, so more than 1 per week. They don't take very long to do, but I didn't feel like I learned much from any of them nor did they test my knowledge very well. They were simple true/false, multiple choice, and fill in the blank questions that basically just took a random sentence from the textbook or lecture and made it into a question. There were a few instances of the \"correct\" answer conflicting with other sources, or differences between the book and the lecture.

This is a fine course and most will enjoy it very much- I certainly did. The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester. \n\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it!",

You will definitely learn a lot if you take it, both in terms of how to think about financial data, some financial concepts, how to work with Python libraries (especially NumPy and Pandas), and some machine learning topics. \n\nI think this course would be a great course to take before Machine Learning, because it introduces you to the topic of machine learning in a more gentle manner than the Machine Learning course. I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay. \n\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule. ",

I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'.

            "text": "I had previously taken the class when it was offered on Udacity as a MOOC before it became a \"for-credit\" class at GT. It's exactly the same. I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not. \n\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily. \n\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\n\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class. \n\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.

The projects have definitely been beneficial, but the organization/timeliness of the course team and how/when these projects were presented and what they actually covered was a bit disappointing. Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that's what the course was about. I'd expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain. I wish we could have spent the time working on some of the things that the extra credit proposed instead of working on developing my own KNN learner, bag (bootstrap aggregator) learner, Qlearner, or Dyna. \n\n... All that said, it really was a great class and I learned a lot. I actually began really liking Python through this course... it's mandatory, so be ready. Those taking the class do come away with a decent set of software that could be further developed to make a nice personal trading system.... or, if motivated enough, I suppose you could even start your own hedge fund.

If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn't inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren't able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI'll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I'm currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere. ",

I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry.",

I was basically watching four or five lectures the day before the assignment was due, not having any problems, coding the project, and getting solid marks. Do NOT try to do that in the ML portion of the course. \n\nThe ML concepts are not difficult, but the projects can take a little work to get right. I probably spent ~16 to ~24 hours on each of the final three projects.

When you're not writing you're working on your project. Oh, you also have a write up for that. Don't believe if anyone says that you only need to do the minimum amount for the papers. The students that are held in high regard for assignments turn in 2x to 3x what is required and everyone else is held to that standard. Th project is ongoing and does not really offer any opportunity to develop meaningful AI algorithms that you learn in class. There is hardly anytime to write a great AI agent because you spend so much time writing. That's what I really couldn't stand about the class, too much talking about theory and not enough time spent on actually implementing the ideas. I'm sure there are students that will argue my experience, but I want to actually program to see what they are talking about actually works in the real world. I felt the lectures were too high level and the examples were at the grade school level. So it was really difficult to find value in the lectures. This is not a critique against the professor and the TA's they are great! It just that the material could have been presented better. If you're looking to learn some cool AI techniques, you're not going to find them here. This class is really an intro to cognitive AI, nothing more. It is broad sweeping with no real substance. ",

A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n1. Feedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know. \n\n2. Group projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group",

Student evaluation:\n\n* Tests - two tests that make up 46% of your final grade are brutal if you don't have an eidetic memory to remember all the content of all the papers. On the final, of 49 students participating in a pole, only 1 thought they got a 90+, 4 thought they got an 80-89 and down, with the largest group < 59. \n\n* Projects - four projects make up 48% of your final grade. The projects were challenging if you aren't a good C programmer, but not overly so. They were a bit under-specified which made it hard to know for sure you were doing things the \"right\" way.

These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought. ",

I spent a lot of time working on this course (at least 20 hours per week), and I did have a CS undergrad for what it's worth (its almost 8 years old). \n\nThe grading scheme is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final. The homework assignments are very challenging, and often times the mean score for an assignment was around 10-11 of 16. There were opportunities for extra credit to improve the homework score. A small minority of these problems are python programming assignments. This should not be your focus in preparation. \n\nThe questions on the midterms and final are easier than the homework, but they are timed and I was unable to attempt all problems on either test. This was very common among other students as well. The mean grades for the exams were in the 50s. The grades are all \"curved\" for lack of a better term to be normalized to a standard 10 point grade bracketing. \n\nYou will definitely want to prepare ahead of time for the course. Some things I wish I had studied prior (and other useful topics):\nMathematical Notation : Summation, Dot Product, etc\nSet Theory\nGraph Theory\nAsymptotic Runtime Analysis (Big-O notation)\nTime Complexity Classes\n\nI highly recommend you check out the lectures on the public Udacity site prior. While they won't necessarily prepare you for the assignments, if you can't understand the notation used in the lectures, you should review it until you do. \n\nOne thing I will mention regarding some of the other reviews: there is a very specific academic integrity guideline when it comes to using outside resources (not the lectures or prescribed textbooks). We had some significant issues with plagiarism concerns on one of the homeworks which led to some grades being lowered to 0. Just follow it to a T and you should have no problem using outside resources to help with the homework problems. ",

The video lectures are great and entertaining for an introduction course to Computer Vision. The questions and answers are mostly managed by students with some participation from the TAs. There is a consistent TA availability for office hours which really helps when solving the problem sets. \n\nThis course is an easy B but a hard A. It is important to do the best you can to get a high grade in the problem sets so you have more points to spare in the final test. I strongly recommend watching all the videos even if the problem sets don't require them. This will help you in your final as it covers more units than the PS. \n\nThe instructor is mostly absent during the course. We got a welcome, a good-bye, and a few messages in between. However, you will learn a lot from the video lectures and the TAs. I wish we had a couple of live Q&A sessions with the professor. \n\nWhen you finish this course, you will definitely have learned a lot and feel stronger in this field. ",

Of course each student is responsible for his/her own grade, but there's a problem if half the students are essentially failing the course. Expect a lot of outside study of the material. The lectures are barely useful. They gloss over the material and give no concrete examples that are on par with the homework. These are some of the shortest lectures of any OMSCS course I've taken (out of 6) and this is the hardest of any of the OMSCS courses by far. That's a problem. I also think the level of mastery expected by the professor is unreasonable in a single course. There should be a prerequisite for this course. The difficulty is just unreasonable for students that are new to the material. It sounds like earlier professors were more reasonable about this and graded accordingly. \n\nMy advice? Until they resolve this situation, skip this one and take the \"Interactive Intelligence\" specialization. ",

            "text": "This was my first class in the OMSCS program and by far this was the best class I have taken during my formal CS education. I did get an A in the course for some perspective. The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)!",

            "text": "This is a very difficult class. I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I'd recommend before beginning the class:\n\n* Get familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions. \n* Familiarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It's also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well). \n\nI can't emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can't imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely). \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn't work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn't so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don't try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn't understand a concept, I'd rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you're working on homework. \n\nHomework:\nFor me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby's assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I'd prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn't think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better. \n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this review, it's to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you're a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense. \n\nTests:\nThe tests were extremely stressful. Unless you're a genius, you probably aren't going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It's not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don't get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn't (and if I didn't get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders *want* to give you points. Write down _anything_, even if you know it's not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps. \n\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I'd fail. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThis is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I've taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they'll change it in future semesters. \n\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you're not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster. \n\nBooks:\nJust go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway. \n\nConclusion:\nThis was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid. At the same time it was extremely stressful. I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting an A if you have other life commitments. Good luck!",

It really does require knowledge of about 36 white papers in order to answer the questions on the exams. I came across 3 questions on each of them that i had no idea what paper they came from, let alone what they were referring to. I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions. The number one contributor gets a 3, everyone else gets something less. There were just a few days difference between our top two contributors (600+ posts each), and one got a 3, while the other got a 2. 9.

            "text": "It's pretty hard for me to give an accurate commentary on this class because I have such an unusual background, but I can only really give advice that would be applicable to the general population interested in taking this course. About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn't even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM. \n\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn't find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you're going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material. \n\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\n\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won't be the case for every single course in the program. So I would take the course just because the experience was well made and well-supported, but definitely make sure that you have the right background before signing up!",

This takes a while because you have to commit a good deal to memory, so make sure you go through these and also all of the previous midterms and finals (which they also post on T-Square), at least a week or two in advance of the tests. \n\nFinally, to prep for the course, I would strongly advise that you brush up on your C coding. You don't need to be a guru, but make sure you have your dev environment properly set up with a decent IDE, and especially know how to debug programs. I didn't have to use valgrind for any of my projects thanks to the copious amount of unit tests that I wrote, but for the final project I did use valgrind to help me locate a bug. So it can only help to be familiar with that tool. \n\nMake sure you also participate in Piazza - those are easy points you don't want to give up ;-p\n\nGood luck to everyone!",

Most requires some tricks. Try your best to complete all. You effort will be rewarded on the exams. Start early. Twice I started the homework on Saturday and had to stay up until 3am on Monday. I don't know if they'll continue to offer extra credit for doing peer reviews, but if they do, don't skip them.

Changing your subproblem algorithms.. etc. \nHours of sleep == fast runtime == optimization\n\nThough I think the direction of the class seems to give more structure to the algorithm model so you can start with dealing the challenge of containing problem into the ideal assumptions rather than piecing the model from scratch. \n\nPay attention to the pre-req: linear algebra (eigenvalues) and some signals/ML(probability/stats)",

This goes over foundational ML on classifiers, optimization, probability, Markov model... then some more. \n\nYou will also learn really quickly that you can't waddle through gradschool by just having coding chops, you have to read papers and you have to decypher textbooks(Tom mitchell). Lectures are mostly overview or summary of what your synthesized understanding should carry you to say that makes sense.

The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy. \n\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I've seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best. \n\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging. \n\nThe quizes are a mess. They're vaguely worded and depend on the instructor's interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you're expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you're penalized because either you missed a nuance that's only clear in the instructor's mind, or because you didn't elaborate (although you're constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material. \n\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90). They finally settled on the vaguely worded tests to make the course appear to be hard even though that's the wrong way to do it. ",

I assure you, as someone who had a couple of C-heavy courses in undergrad and no professional experience with the language, it is not that bad. They give you a ton of code and the assignments kind of write themselves once you get the hang of what they are after. Even so, you should probably expect to spend 20 to 30 hours on two of the four projects. Don't bother with the extra credit options on the projects unless you really want to. They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each. \n\nLectures/Tests\nThe lectures are a little slow paced. I watched most of them on speed-and-a-half, which increased my focus considerably. The midterm and final ask detailed questions from the lectures and also contain quite a bit of application material. Strive for understanding of the lectures, rather than memorization, and you'll be fine. \n\nOverall comments\nI got an A in this class without having to sweat too much, mainly because the curve is generous - 81 to 100 was an A in fall 2015. It's an enjoyable class with some interesting material that I didn't encounter in undergrad. Biggest complaint: nothing got graded until the middle of the semester, because nothing was really due until then. The first project is already divided into four deliverables. Releasing separate grades for those components would help students who are unsure of where they stand. ",

            "text": "It was a very challenging course yet I enjoyed it very much. I did some theoretical computer science research during my undergraduate study. Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it's very challenging for me. \n\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It's ok if you don't understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don't know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation\nF_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately. \n\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it's in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework. \n\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn't mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity. \n\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it's better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won't be uncomfortable. I don't have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best. \n\nHope you all doing well on this course. ",

            "text": "It's not a good sign when a TA calls a test question \"ridiculously counter-intuitive\", and comments that he too would have chosen the incorrect answer. \n\nIf you are intent on thoroughly learning the material presented in this course, beware: Your grade (especially your test grades) may not reflect your knowledge. A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors. \n\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The “select all that apply” multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests. \n\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code. \n\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students’ concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included “that’s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. ” (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given. However, I doubt any of them would have tolerated the mishaps we students had to deal with. \n\nCONCLUSION: This class needs to be scrapped and totally redone. Both the original content and the delivery of that content are atrocities to the OMSCS program. As stated below, this class IN NO WAY does justice to this VERY important field of Computer Science. If you decide to take this class, and learning the material and scoring well is important to you, PREPARE TO BE THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATED. ",

            "text": "For the most part this is an \"intro\" course for finance, machine learning, and the programming libraries used (numpy, pandas, and python in general really). If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course). \n\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas. \n\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.

            "text": "This is a very fun course that is heavily project-based, and most of the projects are at least partially open-ended. The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go \"above and beyond\" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing. \n\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course. \n\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.

            "text": "Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn't going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class. \n\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them. \n\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don't watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the \"optional\" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don't be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing \"optional\" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser. \n\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many \"watch together\" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don't get confused. If you find the \"watch together\" office hours less than useful, don't make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the \"hints\" to the \"tricks\" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby's office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn't allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren't that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. ) \n\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don't expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures. \n\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute \"tricks\" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn't have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former. \n\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too. ",

However in the end I felt it was worthwhile and the projects gave a lot more hands-on practice with some of the methods we studied in the class. \n\nThe first half of the class can be a bit daunting in terms of the amount of material for the midterm - Supervised Learning covers a lot of lectures and most of the textbook for the class. The latter half of the class is a bit less material with respect to studying for the final. In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don't feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm. \n\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with \"analysis paralysis\". \n\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects. \n\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results. \n\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up. So even if you feel bad about the midterm don't give up, submit all the projects and you should end up okay. ",

Yes, I learned a good bit and the concepts in the projects were good. Our class avg on the midterm was a 56. 5 and the median was 57. 75. The grades on the final were mostly C's. Even with such awful grades, I would say they were very gracious in the grading. I got a 77 on the midterm and a 73 on the final, and if they had graded them correctly I would have done much worse. I flat out didn't read the papers, and only studied the videos and my notes on them. I also didn't do the paper summaries and I somehow only got 30% on the message board participation. Actually there were people who posted hundreds of times and were very helpful that only got 2/3 of the participation points. Anyways, I got an 83 unscaled and somehow got an A in the class. Anytime a teach has to scale this much and has such poor test grades, the teacher is doing a poor job. From what I've read, I don't expect other classes to be such a mess though. ",

After reviewing sample projects in the wiki, I felt our batch got quite easy projects :)\n- All in all, it is a wonderful course, even if you are not specializing in computing systems, it is always useful to understand how processors are designed",

In a perfect world, I would prefer to trade some of the writing time and spend it on the optional reading assignments instead. To illustrate the volume, the word count heuristics from the teaching team led to about 15k words in total across all the assignments. I recommend front loading and starting with a strong, steady pace early in the semester. \n\nThe work included a mix of written assignments, code/applied projects, project write ups, exams, and peer feedback. This mixture resulted in a nice balance to the grading, with no one assignment making up the bulk of the course grade. The balance of broad topical coverage with more deep dives in the assignments was also good. \n\nThe teaching team was really great, and the feedback and grades on assignments were returned in a very timely manner. Piazza provided plenty of interesting reading and interaction for those so inclined, from both the teaching team and the students. There were plenty of office hours, and even some optional sessions with external professors on relevant topics. ",

By the end of it, you learn an amazing amount of material. I seem to be in a minority, but I felt the embedded quizzes were great (despite typos & errors) and really helped to reinforce the course material. You can always hit the skip to answer button if you run into trouble. You got credit for just attempting the quizzes. \n\nThere is a partner option for the last two projects which was great. That became an important channel of communication for working out issues that were not addressed via Piazza. \n\nGenerally positive -- I quite enjoyed the project and felt like the effort level involved was quite reasonable (8-15 hours). If you cannot read C++ or figure out undocumented code you will have trouble. This is a real academic simulator, written by people just trying to get things done; commenting was a secondary concern. The actual coding you do is 20-50 lines, the trouble is just figuring out where they go. Having read horror stories about multi-hour simulations from prior terms, I was pleasantly surprised that the simulations took only a couple of minutes. \n\nThe Major issue (as stated by others) -- was the Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. Halfway through the semester instructor (professor / and especially TA) participation fell off a cliff. Shockingly, there was no formal announcement for the Final Exam!\n\nOverall -- the content is great, but be prepared to have to figure things out on your own. Make sure you take the lab partner option as he/she will be one of the best resources to resolve issues that you are unable to post publicly to Piazza. ",

Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun!",

The class gives you a taste of what it might mean to implement machine learning algo in real life - the frustration and uncertainty. If you stick with the course, you will be rewarded! I thought about quitting half-way through the class and received a C on the first homework BUT ended up with an A in the final course. \n\nThere are opportunities for \"extra credit\", where you can show that you have done extra work and get potential lift points if you're in between grades - it is not clear how this is done but it worked to my benefit. The class is very open about sharing algorithms (but not write ups) and discussion boards are full of people exchanging ideas and helping students that are stuck. Very collaborative class and it promotes open sources and sharing in the CS community. Also, I appreciated peer feedback because then I could see how other approached the same question & with different languages. \n\nThis class took over my life for a few months but I am a stronger technical person as a result.

            "text": "I really enjoyed this class. It helped me develop a good understanding of networking and I thought Prof Lillethun and the TAs did a really good job. I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared. ",

            "text": "This course is both very challenging and interesting. The word \"introductory\" in the title can be quite misleading. When I took this course, I presumed that the course teaches OpenMP and MPI. It doesn't. You are required to study these as part of the course and use them in solving the assignments. The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\n\n1. Shared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\n2. Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)\n3. Cache based optimizations\n\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material. \n\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn't complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don't get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments. \n\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams. \n\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A's seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C's seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.

Thrun, is considered one of the pioneers in his field and has a unique teaching style. Also, the TAs were really helpful and know their stuff. \n\nThe class is divided into two parts (lectures with homework) and (two projects). The first part of the course is pretty straight forward. The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that. \n\nTo prepare, I advise:\n1. having a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher). \n2. Artificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful)",

That apparently isn't the goal of the course because the instructors spend their time hand-waving and the assignments have you spend time debugging against shoddy tools. You won't learn to troubleshoot the thought process or algorithms, just to fiddle at the margins with the tools provided. The people who give this course favorable reviews are very strong coders but very weak on theory and math; they pull through because they can plug & chug the coding assignments and use the crappy tools. Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments. Basically if you're modestly good at Java (or expertly good with Python and R ML libraries) and have a lot of time to learn to use APIs for existing ML tools, then you're fine. Perhaps that's what all CS courses are like?",

Kind of let videos play while doing other things. Group projects w/ moderate amount of design documentation. The projects seem to be 6-8 hours of work for 4 people so far. Actually it's hard to divide up the projects because they are just too short for 4 people. It's as much effort to coordinate as it is to do the work and doesn't explore group techniques like SDP. More or less, we've all done all of the first 2 projects, and then just met to combine for the best answer. Easily one of the easier courses in the program, though there is a little interesting material and I hope the last section will be a little more involved. If you've never seen a database, there may be a bit of vocab to absorb. It has fostered some okay discussion; not as much as SDP did. You do need the book. Lectures are mostly project info & book summary. ",

The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging.

When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.

            "text": "TL;DR: This is a fascinating class, but seriously consider taking it by itself. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Fascinating topics (OpenMP, MPI, caching)\n-Dr. Vuduc keeps the lectures lighthearted and interesting. \n-You get 2 \"48 hour\" late passes to turn projects in late with full credit. \n-You get a \"48 hour make your performance better\" period if you don't like where your grade is after they're released. This only applies if you actually turned something in though. They take the top result, so you don't need to worry about your grade going down. \n-The Piazza forum is active (with both the TAs and Dr. Vuduc replying). \n-Grading is fair. \n\nTHE BAD:\n-The projects take a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. Even with a very good knowledge of C/C++ I found that I was still spending 30-40+ hours on each project (except for lab0). Heed what others are saying. Do *not* wait till the weekend they're due. \n-The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn't very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don't expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. \n-The projects have *roughly* a two week cadence. So you're always going to be working on something for this class (circle back to comment in the TL;DR). \n-Office hours aren't consistent. We'll have one every week and then nothing for 2-3 weeks. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe class averaged 23. 8/50 on the midterm and it was curved to being out of 40. While they didn't have to curve at all; this meant the majority of the class got a D or lower on the exam. Some of us were disappointed that last semester the average was 19/50 and it was curved to out of 30. To be fair though, two people got above 40 which is what likely \"broke\" the curve. \n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n-Have a good working knowledge of C/C++. Especially pointers. \n-Go to (or watch) the office hours. \n-Give the class the time it needs. ",

The video lectures are interesting, funny and clear, they are truly great lectures. However, I found the TA-ing not to be involved enough or maybe the flow of information itself was not enough. \n\nThe workload is quite heavy, there were a few assignments I spent 20+ hours on (just the coding itself). Grading is okay, though the requirements are not always 100% clear. Also the workload distribution is not even so be sure to jump into the assignments very early on, especially the first few. Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback. All these result in a lot of noise on Piazza, you have to go through 10K+ posts on piazza during the semester if you want to keep up. \n\nThey dropped MATLAB Fall2015, from now on you can only do your homework in Python. And unless you are good at Python (including advanced things like optimization and parallelization in NumPy), you'll spend a few nights debugging for sneaky bugs or screaming over algorithms that run for 40 minutes. \n\nAll in all: it is a good class but there is a room for some improvement. The material is great, the assignments are hard but rewarding. ",

He more or less establishes a standard (most consider it on the overzealous side of the spectrum) and grades accordingly. It is rather appalling to take a course where the instructor doesn't instruct, the lectures are given by a previous instructor and TA, but they aren't always on target with the course requirements and the level of rigor that is required, the instructors are somewhat responsive on the forum (the only clsas contact is via Piazza), office hours are explicitly NOT conducted, and NO outside resources or collaboration are allowed on homework! Basically, self-teach, but you're not even allowed differing perspectives to help really solidify what the student is supposed to learn. Sure, there are problem sets that are circulated that students are allowed to collaborate on and use outside resources for, but there really isn't much time to do those if focusing on the required homeworks first. Also, it's more miss than hit that the instructor will provide solutions to the practice problems to know if you're getting it or not. If you're up for a quite hefty challenge that definitely is a psychological one as well, go for it, but know it will be rough. It's fairly demoralizing, and I've taken undergrad algorithms, theory, discrete math and proofs within the past 7 years! There were some changes between this past fall and the present semester, but unless they make MAJOR changes to where this course is actually taught and supported, I'd recommend going with the II specialization unless you're determined to struggle for the specialization you really want. I understand it's a tough subject and students should expect a challenge, especially from an institution like GA Tech, but the department really should evaluate their strategy for this one. Also, check the instructor's reviews prior to the program... not very positive previously w/ other subjects!",

The class covers a wide swathe of the machine learning spectrum. The lectures themselves don't get too deep, but they do a good job of familiarizing you with a lot of concepts. \n\nThere is quite a bit of supplemental reading, both with the primary text and several other papers. Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount. \n\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular. \n\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It's tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence. Budget your time appropriately. \n\nFor some of the projects it is likely that you will end up using ABAGAIL, which is maintained by Pushkar. It's pretty solid, although it has some blemishes. My only complaint with it is that there are standing bugs in it which are fixed by several-month-old pull requests. You can go and find these yourself, but they really should be merged. \n\nI've only had the midterm so far, and I must admit it is probably one of the hardest I've ever had. It is intentionally hard. My understanding is not that it is meant to weed people out, but to separate the truly outstanding students. \n\nOverall, if you like machine learning and you're willing to take on a tough course, I highly recommend this one.

But by the second time I was getting a little tired of it, and now I'm working on v3 and I'm not so excited about it. \n\nThe reason is, I feel the project has devolved into a test of my image processing skills rather than an test of knowledge-based AI programming.

Most problems probably due to first time offering\n\nIt's best to think of these class as seminar where the lectures are really only a cursory review of the material but you are then expected to do independent research to implement the assignments. (One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren't tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline. \n\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there's no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn't get it solved? Too bad. Students aren't allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don't have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums. \n\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As. I was getting a high A when I dropped. I dropped because of the lack of feedback. \n\nI'm optimistic that future iterations will work a lot of the 'first-time-offered' bugs out. ",

Its a great intro, but a follow up classes would be even better. \n\nI would liked to see more on how to implement systems at scale, quantifying different signals, methods on how to automate trading with API's, etc. \n\nHighly recommend.",

You might (policy can change) see those questions reappearing in the exams. \n\nA tip about getting most out of your study group, be very WELL prepared. Do not expect to discuss and learn on the fly, you'll fall behind and/or not understanding what is being discussed.

Nearly every single assignment due date has been revised once or twice. The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what's going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response). \n\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these. Every 2-3 weeks another little quiz is due that tests whether or not you've watched the lectures - I can mostly ignore these until they're due, watch the group of lectures on fast forward in less than an hour, and then take the (open book/notes) quiz using the lecture transcripts for reference. The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal. \n\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn't help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed. It's hard to know if the project is going in a reasonable direction for a solid grade. *shrug* I guess we'll see. \n\nThere was supposed to be some interesting programming exercises for working with FHIR. This was updated to be some quizzes instead. Apparently, they thought the Masters Computer Science students were too incompetent to figure out some programming exercises. \n\nGaTech really needs to reevaluate this one...

I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material. The course is about the software development process, not coding, and it covers a lot of tools that aren't relevant to me as a working programmer, e. g. UML, Rational Unified Process, e. t. c. However this is the point of the course so I shouldn't be too surprised :)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper to take if you're new to OMSCS and want an easier paper to start with, to learn the ropes of taking papers. If you've already met your foundational requirement, and aren't interested in more enterprisey processes, and are looking for challenging papers, then I wouldn't recommend this one. However I must emphasise again, how well Alex and the TA's run this course. ",

A lot of mysteries in ML for me are answered in this class. I tend to disagree with other people about the assignments though...

The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated.

My review below is not a reflection of the Instructors, but solely the content and assignments for the course. \n\nI was quite disappointed in this course. The projects were simple and typically didn't require much effort assuming basic Python knowledge; Less than 2 hours each. I would've expected the projects to be more challenging considering my undergraduate Computer Networks class involved implementing a subset of functionality for an FTP server in C, given only the RFC document. The exams, of which there were 2, were typical memorize and regurgitate style with multiple choice and free response questions through ProctorTrack. \n\nThe content did not fit what I expected from a Computer Networks class. It seemed to be a hodge podge of select topics in the computer networking realm. I honestly didn't get much out of the class. \n\nIf you want an easy class and are ok with the typical memorize and regurgitate style of exams, then this is the class for you. ",

I didn't know python going in, and it was easy to pick up, so don't worry if you don't know it before hand. The course seems to have changed format from before. Now there are 2 exams, roughly corresponding with midterm and final. There is probably about 7-10 academic papers to read. The video lectures are from the old format, and don't match up well with the projects or papers. The video lectures also tend not to explain things well or thoroughly. I found myself on multiple occasions going to wikipedia to look up topics in order to understand them better. Fairly easy class. ",

The second half of the class, which I consider to start with cryptography, is a little more challenging, but it is not difficult to grasp the concepts. \n\nMy favorite part was the projects - 4 projects + 4 optional, of the optional you only can do 1. \nProject 1 - Easy, work with C and gdb\nProject 2 - Easy, triggering malware\nProject 3 - Easy, basically doing a test for an app that one of the TA's built - Very bad project in my opinion because I didn't learn anything and really did not get anything out of it. \nProject 4 - Easy, you \"hack\" a fake website. \nNot as easy as the other 3, but if you know JS and HTML you will be fine. It took me a bit more time than the others simply because I was confused as to what I was doing. \n\nMidterm was not difficult, all true/false and multiple choice questions. You can only answer them one at a time, so that was annoying because you could not go back and double check. The questions were similar to the Quizzes, but some of the questions did get me. \n\nI should mention this is my first class in the program and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new and thinking about taking it.

The lectures were actually pretty good throughout the first half of the course but became more technical and less well explained during the second. The projects were not difficult, but I don't feel that they added anything to my understanding of the concepts. \n\nThe major problem I had with this course was the quizzes. The multiple choice questions were loaded with ambiguous answers, which still seemed ambiguous after watching the lectures multiple times and scouring Google for information. It often felt like you were left with 2 or 3 equally plausible choices and then forced to make a guess. There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution. There were 2 times in the beginning where I was penalized for not including all the information - I knew the information that I had left out, I tried to imply it in the response as much as possible, but didn't know how to get it all in there given the short answer length. I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit. This to me seems like a flaw - it felt to me that the grade was less about understanding and more about memorization. \n\nThis may be a harsh review, but I really didn't like this class. ",

The lectures cover an extremely wide range of topics, while there is sometimes more of an emphasis on the math than the intuition, you come away with a lot. \n\nThe projects you work on in this course are some of the coolest things I've ever worked on. If they offered another CV course with more projects like this, I would take it in a heartbeat. Seeing the output of an algorithm that you implemented to track a hand in a video for example, that's just awesome. \n\nThe time requirement is very real. The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it. I would HIGHLY recommend learning numpy and at least brushing up on opencv basics before taking this course. I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course. Also, I did not do this, but I wish I had taken Computational Photography first. There were a few posts on Piazza about how much that helped. ",

Multiple projects were plagued with technical difficulties which, in some cases, kept students from being able to complete them. Others go fairly far beyond the material covered in class. This would be fine for more open-ended project requirements (we should all expect to do some solo research and problem-solving in a masters degree program), but it seemed that many students relied heavily upon the expertise of a few industry professionals amongst the student body to guide them through. Exams are somewhat boring and quizzes are word-for-word copies of book sentences. Again, not a terrible class, but not as well done as others I've taken in OMSCS. Definitely a class you can pair with another, though set aside lots of extra time if you want to get more out of it than just a good grade. ",

The workload was probably lower in the second half. Also, there is lots of extra credit available throughout the class. It seems a sizeable amount of students did not finish all of the assignments, but if you do, there is a good chance you can get >100%. \n\nThere is not much info in the lectures, but there is some good info in the labs. The professor wants students to learn by doing. Personally, I agree that this is the best way to learn (by trying to tackle something I am not quite sure how to do yet), but I can understand some students preferring a more structured approach, where they are told more explicitly how to do what they need to do. I would say the most important skill in this class is just to be a quick learner. \n\nOverall, I learned more in this class than any other I have taken. I would recommend this class if you have any interest in using big data tools. Just don't expect an easy class. I would probably take this class by itself or paired with an easier class. ",

I remember when I was in undergrad, there were different versions of physics classes of varying difficulty for different majors. The easiest version was for humanity majors, which was mostly high-level and conceptual, and was dubbed \"physics for poets\". I felt this class was \"AI for poets\".

A majority of the assignments were not too difficult and only took a few hours. On the other hand, the ones that were harder than average seemed almost impossible to complete. The lectures were very well done and he gives you just about everything you need to know to trudge and sweat your way through the exams. (The exams were open note... but they really aren't useful except to try to confirm some basic facts you aren't 100% sure of. ) That's because most of the time on the exam will be spent trying to decipher most of the questions that seem to be written as a brain teaser than an exam question. If the exam questions were more straightforward, I would be happier with this class overall. Do not try to cheat your way through this class. He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS). I didn't cheat, but it still stressed me out a lot that there were announcements saying people who cheated should confess or be reported to the dean. I would always worry that the system might flag my submission as a false positive when it was analyzed. This is probably the second most stressful class I've taken in the program. If I knew what I was getting into with this one, I probably would have just taken something else. The topics covered were far from what I was expecting. I wish they would break this into 2 classes... One for testing and one for analysis. I don't think I gained much personal benefit from the analysis part and very little useful knowledge from the testing part... Overall, a thumbs down from me. The biggest positive right now is that I took the final yesterday and I am just so happy that is over and done!",

No teaching. Just threats, dictates, and grades. I am riding it out mostly as an experiment and will not re-take it when I flunk. I am so glad this is not my first OMSCS class, because I would absolutely quit the program if it were. Treat this as a certification exam on your PhD level understanding of discrete math symbology and language, proofs (which many have not been bothered with since the 9th grade), and 1800 pages of at least 2 if not 5 incredibly dense textbooks. Know it up front, because you won't learn it from the class. A Computer Science class where you can't use a computer or calculator is just ironic and tragic. If you really want to learn this stuff you need to take this on-campus and choose your professor carefully. I see minimal value in the knowledge required to get an A in this class unless you are going into academia or just want to sit around with mathematicians and argue about P vs NP theory (I assure you the professional STEM world has better things to do). \n\nIt sounds like the course in Spring 2016 is MUCH different from previous semesters, so beware.

You can easily find youself wasting all your project time on trying to make these decisions. One important note is that the curve is very kind. Fight the urge to drop the class because of results and difficulty; it is worthwhile to stick with it.

You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught.

I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well. ",

Scala , Spark, mllib, graphx (HW3, HW4, project)\n4. vagrant (I dint have to go beyond setting it up and running some scripts)\n5. aws-docker, I dint use it just played with for project\n6. Heath informatics and machine learning concepts\n7. IntelliJ and Pycharm were the editors I used. Makes your life tad bit easier. \n\nYou are allowed to use any of the big data framework for project but I used scala and spark. \n\nIts a great course and I took it along side ML. They kind of complemented with each other and they deadlines dint overlap much, so worked for me. ",

I felt like the material could have been presented in a more natural manner, even though there were many technical terms to explain. \n- Quizzes could definitely be improved. Many of the questions were taken straight from the textbook. If the instructors wrote their own quizzes, it could challenge the students to learn and understand the material better. \n- Lots of reading to do from the textbook if you want to get the most from the course. Although the instructor says all the quiz answers can be derived from the slides, I think some of that is a far stretch. I feel it is easier to personally fill in the gaps through reading the textbook. \n- Projects were enjoyable and challenging. There were four in total. The third was a new one in this semester that had a lot of technical issues and bugs. I don't think it was an appropriate project to ask students to test out a smartphone app. Fortunately, there was an alternative option for that project (which was a literature project and designing a smartphone app that uses pki). \n- Bonus extra credit was available if you complete additional problems related to a project. \n- Exams were fair. Multiple choice and T/F on proctortrack. \n- Professors and TAs were helpful. They even held office hours almost everyday in the week! That is amazing!!\n- Overall I enjoyed the content and recommend others to take this course too. ",

It's not so much that the course material is hard, but the material is so poorly taught (the lecture videos do not match the style and level of difficulty of the assignments and exams) and the marking scheme so sensitive to even the slightest error (one minor error in a problem can result in the loss of 1/3 of your validity points and two small errors can result in the loss of 2/3 of them) that getting a decent score on an assignment or exam is a constant struggle. Having now completed this course, I feel incredibly proud of myself, regardless of what my grade ultimately turns out to be.

Make sure you brush up on python, numpy, and linear algebra before you take it. There is some simple calculus, but mostly linear algebra. If you're not comfortable with matrices and their operations some of the projects will be difficult. Projects 2 (hough), 6 (optical flow), and 7 (particle filters) were the most challenging and time consuming. The final was open book/notes and covered all sections of the lecture. It wasn't difficult if you covered all of the lectures and mostly stuck to higher level questions than minutiae. The one thing I really disliked about this class, and computer vision in general, is the parameter tuning/fitting. One will spend a lot of time doing that for the projects in this class to make things work. The most difficult thing for me was keeping up with the lecture/notes while also doing the projects.

I felt that the two person teaching format worked really well for the course, to the point where I started to question why all courses didn't do this. It sort of reminded me of the back and forth in a RadioLab podcast. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and even though I have some background in Machine Learning, I felt I took away a lot of new insights from this course. \n\nIs it hard? I guess. I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course. ",

I personally did not have much big data experience but by the time I completed the homework assignments I was ready to design and implement a large scale experiment on Hadoop for my project without major issues. \n\nOn the negative side, the lectures and other course content are pretty thin. There was a fairly large gap between content the course provides and what was needed to actually complete the assignments, so most of what I learned in the course was through looking up tutorials and other course materials on the Internet. By far the biggest negative was the workload required for the first three homework assignments, I spent at least 40+ hours per week on the assignments over the six weeks that were given to complete them. The assignments themselves were not necessarily difficult to complete (although one assignment required deriving an equation used throughout the rest of the assignment which the course itself in no way prepares you for), but it's very much as if an entire semester's worth of assignments are crammed into that first part of the course. There were some other minor negatives to the course, mostly in the form of the course being disorganized and instructions being vague or conflicting. \n\nOverall I would say this could be a great course and I personally learned a lot from it, but I can't recommend it in its current form.

The projects definitely ramped up as the class went on but I really liked how the professor made each project build on top of each other. As long as you stay on top of your projects, build out your projects modularly, comment your code well, and don't overly procrastinate this class should be relatively straightforward. The midterm can be a bit tricky with the programming problems but the professor did provide a great study guide - use this and you will do fine on the midterm!

By the look of the grade of final project, probably less than 15% people actually implemented QLearning trades generator, which is really the whole point of the class. \n\nToward the end, you are building a QLearning agent to do automated trades generation, which is quite cool to detach QLearning from the more common \"robot in a maze\" application. The future offering is likely to disperse the loads a bit more so the end project isn't so compressed where the common time working on them is upward of 30-40 hours.

Congratulations!\n \nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\n \nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best. \n \nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range. \nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time. \n \nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.

This year, two of the projects were group projects with the final agile project being an individual project. \n\nWhile it's not a make or break, coming into the class with an intermediate level of Java is probably best.

I'd even go as far as to say that this course actually prepared me for a separate assignment in another course which helped me apply what I was learning while taking this one. As a qualification, I am of the student build that didn't come with a complete CS background, instead having a degree in IT with an emphasis in programming. However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps. I expect that the course will get better with time. ",

The lectures are not the most entertaining ones, but the organization is very good and I had no trouble following through. The assignments and exams focus heavily on application of concepts and problem solving. \n\nEach assignment involves reading the documentation on your own. It sounds intimidating but once you get your hands dirty with some examples, the problems aren't impossible. You can even get away with reading minimal amount of documentation. I'm not sure if the tools you learn in the assignments will be used in your future career, but they do serve the purpose of helping you learn. You'll need some knowledge about Java and at least be able to debug pointer related errors. The exams are difficult but open notes. It involves some tricks and a lot of thinking. \n\nRegarding plagiarism, the solution as simple as \"don't do it\". There's no need to worry that your one-sentence code will most likely be the same as someone else'. The teaching staff know well enough about software testing to avoid false positives. Anti-plagiarism is not your enemy unless you are happy to graduate with students who cheat their way. ",

The course work was way out of balance, with the first half (or so) of the course having almost no work and the last half being heavily loaded. Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to \"study\" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse. A lot of my frustration came from Pandas (a python module) which has a really annoying and backwards API and doesn't adhere to the way things are generally done in Python.

This course is very helpful in many ways, one of which is that the concepts covered here are used in pretty much every other course (and I've taken 2 others so far). At the end of the day, computer science is a lot about math - not just programming, and understanding the principles behind the programs we write is just as important. I was just as frustrated when taking the course - the countless times I've complained, the near nervous breakdowns and the constant frustration of not being able to solve the assignment problems on my own. However, it's been over a year since I took this course and I am still enjoying the fruits of it. Also, it doesn't matter if you get an A or a B on this course - what matters is how much you learn. To be honest grades don't really dictate success in life anyways. A few things to succeed in this course\n\n1. Be prepared - take some preparatory courses if this is the first time you are taking such a course. There are plenty on Coursera on Design of Algorithms. \n2. Set aside at-least 30 hours a week. If you are working and have a family, ensure that this is the only course you take that term. \n3. Struggle on the assignments - try as hard as you can on each of the problems. But don't be afraid to ask the TAs for hints and to Google for help (don't cheat, but ask for help and cite your references). \n4. The video lectures are not sufficient. Read the textbooks - especially ones recommended for each section. \n5. Solve as many problems as you can - Google for exam papers from other colleges. ",

Picking the right datasets. You have to use the same dataset in 3 assignments, so ensure that you pick datasets \n- running a bunch of classifiers on them to ensure that they don't all predict in the same or similar range, nor are they too easy (>95% accuracy) or too difficult (<50% accuracy)\n- ensuring you understand the underlying data - you'll have to really care about the data else you'll have a hard time explaining your results\n2. Switching from Java to Python and back\n\nI'd recommend sticking with the following libraries/packages for the various assignments \n1. Weka for Assignment 1 (many also used Python and R)\n2. ABAGAIL for Assignment 2 (This has a lot of starter code to help you)\n3. Scikit Learn for Assignment 3 (Weka has ICA missing)\n4. BURLAP for Assignment 4",

The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved. ",

If you have been a programmer professionally for years and forgotten most of your undergrad then this course will be extremely difficult. The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly.

Agree with comments I have read so far and I'll add my take. \n\nClass spends one third teaching you Python/Numpy/Pandas. Professor already indicated that will shrink that part. I'd feel torn at leaving it out. I had already taken the ML class and had to decide by myself if to learn R or Python while at the same time going through lectures and that was painful. So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it. \n\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it. \n\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it. \n\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza. Piazza becomes a firehose of posts and the professor replied to at least one third of them with followups. \n\nIf there would be a second part for this class I'd definitely sign up!",

            "text": "This class is not like any other class in the program (as of today). Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it. ",

But you will learn a ton of math. Just be ready to work a lot. No other courses, no large commitments. Good luck!\n\nI spent 20+ hours every week of the semester on this class. 8 hours in an online study group, the rest by myself working the homework problems or the problem set. I learned a lot about LaTeX. \n\nThis is a math course. It's probably better off without the python. But you also probably don't know enough about writing in Math yet, so this is really difficult. From set theory and countability of infinite sets to graph theory and vertex covers and maximum matchings. There is a lot of math. The programs you will discuss are programs that will always output the reverse of the program given as an input, or a program that when run will output a program that when run that will output.... (etc. ) There is a lot of Logic. \n\nThe professor and TAs are working to make the course delivery better. Ideas have already paid off and they have more. They know it's tough and a lot to learn. The real problem, though, is that it's really two 3 credit courses given in the time of one. So this course is about as fun as drinking from a firehose. And I didn't even want to learn this much math. SOME math, sure. But this is a ton. \n\nAdvice: Work all the problem set problems. A few of them showed up exactly from the problem set on the test. Others illustrate how to push boundaries of the section's ideas. Also read Sipser. Generally avoid the udacity lectures, which seem rushed and not very instructive. ",

There were three projects, all related to an application that needed to optimize the scheduling of classes. It was an exciting and challenging exercise. The final deliverable takes time, so start as soon as possible. \n\nThe final exam wasn't particularly complicated and it was open notes. You can pass it using the video lectures alone. I studied like crazy and then found it to be easier than expected. \n\nOn this class, you work on teams. I began to be very picky during the selection process, and I ended up with a great team.

I didn't know what I was getting into until the classes started, but quickly I realized this was going to be tough. \n\nThere's more material in this course that what you can cover without going nuts. The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to. \n\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up. \n\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade.",

They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\". \n\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it's also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\n\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I've heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That's unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material. \n\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average. \n\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you'll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard. You'll get exposed to a lot of interesting ideas and use a variety of tools to explore those ideas, which hopefully encourage you to learn more in the future. I highly recommend this course. ",

It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light.

Its good to be back learning OOAD again. \nThis course has a very interesting perspective on teaching UML and OOAD. \nYou have to know or learn ILP and java since the solver is java based\nThere are no fixed answers to the projects since in real life there are no fixed design solutions. \nThe same with the requirements. In real life requirements tend to be vague and it takes a good analyst to fill in the blanks. \nTake this course with an open mind and you will learn a lot. ",

            "text": "This is my first course of the OMSCS program, overall great learning experience. The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are engaged, and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you into the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. I am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with C. This is mostlikely the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background and skill sets of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\". \n\nThe content of the course is really straightforward, i would rate the difficulty for the course content 3. However, the programming assignments are substantially more difficult for those who are not experienced with C. I rate it 4. 2. Given the fact that project assignment takes about 3 times more time than the course content, the weighted difficulty is 3. 9. \n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course. ",

If you have taken ML in this program, you will find the ML section comparatively very light and you should pretty much know everything, but I do feel I gained something from having to implement some of the algorithms myself. \n\nIf you had asked me half-way through the semester, I would have said this is probably the easiest class I have ever taken. But, the last third of the class covers the ML topics and the workload ramps up a bit, although it still was not too heavy. Just don't completely sleep on it. I would love to have seen a larger focus on the ML section and I believe Professor Balch has indicated he may do so in the future. This is a good class to consider pairing up with a harder class. \n\nFinally, Professor Balch was awesome. He was amazingly active on the forums, held many office hour sessions, and overall just seemed genuinely interested in giving us the best learning experience possible. ",

I'd expect something like this from University of Phoenix, not Georgia Tech. The first 2/3 of the course require minimal effort if you're familiar with NumPy, as Pandas is pretty easy to pick up. The first 1/3 of the course is \"Hurray! Pandas is awesome!\" and taught in video by a TA. This videos are super short, and if you want to actually learn something about ML, read Mitchell's machine learning book and the papers it references. \n\nBooks:\nPython for Finance: skip. Everything in this book is online. \nMitchell's Machine Learning: If you want to actually learn the machine learning parts\nWhat Hedge Funds Really Do: Oversimplified, but an ok introduction. Used in the midterm, but way overpriced. \n\nThe assignment specs don't get posted in full until late, with many sharp edges on them regarding requirements. Most of the time you need to use Piazza and office hours to figure out what they actually want you to make. Assignments must be submitted with everything crammed into one or two *. py files. They also expect you to copy-paste code from your old assignment file into the next source file they expect you to make. Cool idea to build a module, bad implementation. \n\nTwo of our homework assignments were to write questions for the midterm, and we were graded (originally) on the acceptability of the questions.

Nothing is impossible but every single part of every assignment is time consuming. There are 4 homework assignments due every 2 weeks for the first part of the course and a project for the second half. Every assignment involves serious effort. Expect to spend several full days on each. This course covers several big data tools, but it's not a programming course. So you need to learn on your own well enough to finish the assignments. Make sure you start early. Assignments are assessed by autograding using different data sets than the ones you have, so I kind of miss the Udacity autograder that I used to hate, since at least you know you get it when you get it. The project focuses more on your ability to interpret data and understand the topic you choose. Your report/paper will be graded for the project, not your code. \n\nThe instructors and TAs are very active on piazza and helpful. It's a new course so there are some problems every once a while, so make sure you keep an eye on the announcement and pinned messages, in case there's any code or instruction update.

The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I'm surprised the instructors didn't put the kibosh on that. )\n\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn't quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new. Dr. Mark, while no longer actively researching, clearly is an expert in the topic and has great opinions. The lead TA did a commendable job keeping things organized. It was a good experience. ",

            "text": "Absolutely horrible course. Video lectures are completely useless for learning. Instructors have implemented a very poor teaching style. Practice problems with no solutions? What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources. ",

I actually got more out of reading the recommended background text (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach) than I did out of the course itself. The projects are a joke; a couple hours a piece. The final project was 7 lines of code. So, you'll knock those out quickly, especially with help from your Piazza buddies. The tests I had a mixed experience with. I thought the first was pretty easy and the homeworks prepared you for it. The second I thought deviated quite a bit from the homeworks. Since it's closed book and you get just 2 hours, I was screwed on that one. I wish they made it clearer what topics will be on the test. Also, there were only two tests during the semester. I think there should be at least 3 or 4, so you're not just cramming bits of knowledge in your brain only to forget them later. ",

            "text": "This is an introductory course to the fundamental OS concepts, a good review of all relevant OS topics. The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs. \n\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early. \n\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there. \n\nOverall, it is a very good class. It can be frustrating in the beginning, but if you stick to it and go through the whole semester, you will probably learn a lot. ",

The assignments can be very challenging and count for a large percentage of your grade. In fact if you do well in the assignments you can still do well in this course despite the extremely difficult midterm and finals. \nGoing into this course, I'd make sure you take the prerequisites seriously. Know you algorithmic analysis. I found that I had to brush up on a few areas of maths during the course which didn't help under the heavy workload. Knowing some linear algebra is also helpful as 2 large sections of the course work with matrices. The assignments are mostly done in C, so make sure you're well versed with that. The level of C needed is (imho) about the same as that for AOS or similar courses. \n\nThe class is hard because achieving high performance is a difficult problem. If you do this class, you'll discover that even something simple like sorting which you may have mastered from undergrad now becomes an order of magnitude more complex and if you don't do it right you may have severely degraded performance even though you have N times more computing power. \n\nI highly recommend this class. Even if you're not solving a problem across many compute nodes, performance will always be important and this class will give you the right tools to write high performance software. ",

The readings are tough, but help to understand the meaning and math behind the algorithms. \n\nThere seemed to be a trend in grading where the supervised and unsupervised assignments received lower scores than the randomized optimization and markov decision process assignments. I was around the mean for most assignments, did a few points above the mean for the midterm, did better on my final, and somehow ended up with an A for the course grade. Strangely enough, I don't feel like I deserve an A because theres still so much to understand and it was clear from the piazza forum that others had a solid grasp of the material. That being said, I do want to go on and learn more about ML!\n\nMy advice for this course would be to get started on assignments early. I tend to procrastinate and the grade on my first assignment showed that. As you work through the assignments, you'll find more and more questions that you'll try to answer. In order to have an interesting paper that fits the page limits, you must be able to explain why your experimenting showed the results that it did concisely yet comprehensively.

I found the exams to be more difficult than the assignments personally, mostly due to the format. Sadly, I didn't do as well on them as I would have liked and feel I could have done better on them. My recommendation is to take detailed notes as you watch the lectures and read the papers. Especially take notes as you read the papers. Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you're watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you're having difficulty focusing on the lectures. \n\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit. \n\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you're going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\n- Learn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you'll need it (you probably don't)\n- Learn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you're not comfortable with the language's semantics you'll be overwhelmed on the first assignment. \n- Learn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there. \n\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn't adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent. Professor Ada and the TAs were super responsive. I don't recall ever having to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a response ever. I definitely recommend taking this course. ",

Starner and his work in Sign Language recognition, wearable computing, and Dolphin communication. This course was the initial offering of 6601 for the OMSCS program. The professor and the TAs input an enormous amount of effort to pull off this course - my thanks to them. As a note of context, this course was advertised to be offered in Spring '16 and then cancelled late Fall '15 and then surprisingly re-released at the 11th hour. \n\nAs the course advertises in its description, it is intended for those who have some background in AI or are ready to jump into the deep end (true statement) The description asks for 9 hrs per week and it should be modified to reflect the true effort required in this class. Most students, including myself, input 20+ hours per week to stay afloat. Most of the time you spend will be on solving an assignment and researching. It's very easy to forget that you have to watch the lectures as well! \n\nThe professor's assignment methodology was to introduce a concept through lecture, then complete some 'warm-up' problems in the beginning of each assignment to develop intuition. At the end of the warm-up, you solve more difficult problems by implementing solutions that had not been explicitly covered in class. This was certainly the most rewarding and difficult part of the class!\n\nThere were several first-time hiccups in assignments and exams, however the TAs and the professor had open ears and minds and ultimately made it right and I'm sure that the next offering of this course will be even better. \n\nI learned an incredible amount about the material even though I felt overwhelmed during the majority of the course. This is certainly an opportunity to become familiar with the AI field with an intensive, hands-on experience from which you will benefit greatly. ",

            "text": "Let me first state that my review isn't really fair since I had to spend more time with an even more difficult course, Big Data for Health Informatics. \n\nThis class taught me a lot. I ended up with a C, and I think it was just due toward the end of the class where I couldn't focus on it so much because I was spending all my time with my other life sucker of a class. \n\nThe material in this course is dense, rigorous, but it did seem regularized. The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems. I really had a time crunch, but like I said, I unknowingly set myself up for it by taking the big data class. \n\nThere could be something fundamental I was not getting, but over all, even if I liked it to some extent, this isolation method didn't seem like the best way to learn. I get it, that a degree in any establishment is given better credit when the students are not spoon fed answers. Yet, I felt like I did not have the proper tools to achieve an A. It's frustrating for sure, I don't know if I should take another semester and switch specializations or just try it again. I am a bit discouraged after it all. I did try to understand the material as I have done with my other classes. \n\nYeah, don't take this with any other high demanding course. Please don't. ",

Make sure to prepare for this course in advance. You'll want to focus mostly on proof writing, make sure you understand how to prove direct, induction, and by contradiction. \n\nWhen taking the class, make sure to take time to work through the problem sets. The homework is harder than the exams, but you have two weeks for each assignment and have the ability to submit revised answers based on the homework feedback, so don't let the homework take too much time away from working through problem sets as they will help sharpen your intuition. Get the CLRS book, it's not really optional. \n\nThe lectures videos aren't that good, the videos Chris made for select problem set solutions were great and helped a lot before the exam. \n\nOverall it's a good class. Would be better with better videos. You probably won't be able to apply anything here, but I do feel like it will sharpen your mind and improve your problem solving skills. It's a lot of work so either take it alone or take it with an easier class. ",

Unfortunately, I could not enjoy it as much because I took 6505 CCA along with this course, but I still got a lot out of it. \n\nThings I liked\n- hands on exposure with real big data in a practical field (medical)\n- exposure to technologies that are currently being used in the field today. \n- the guest lectors. \n- Hands on experience on what machine learning really is capable of doing. \n- good community of help through Piazza. \n\nThings that I wasn't so fond of but are good\n- hacking away, just trying to get things set up before I could even run my code. You should really have experience working on a linux server so you can start using AWS and the hadoop environment. \n- Trying to differentiate equations that weren't ever mentioned in the course lectors or course prerequisites\n- making matrix multiplication work through Spark. \n- Easy Chair. it was anything but easy... or a chair. \n\nThings I didn't like \n- sometimes I felt TAs were very short. I can't entirely blame them, there is a lot on their plate. I wanted to turn in a newer version of my final project which I knew was still within the deadline. Not much luck talking about it. \n- Class still has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. How to give feedback on the final project wasn't very clear until the last moment. \n- First homework assignment was using python pandas/numpy environment. Easy, know it already. Anyone that has already taken Machine Learning probably already knows about that environment. it would have been better if there was an assignment on the AWS EMR environment with a little bit of python to follow through. \n- Main lectures were interesting but almost completely useless. \n\nI was deceived. Somewhere probably on the syllabus, I remember reading that this course would most likely take over 15 hours every week. So I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. 20 or so a week was something I could manage. it was more than double that. ",

All projects are good and doable in few hours - but you have to spend a lot more to make sure that you don't make a typo / small mistake. A small mistake in any of the project means that you lost \"A\" grade... My suggestion will be that if you are looking for \"A\" - make sure that you spend those extra hours to iron out any issues. \n\nTests are closed book. So, that's a bummer - I haven't done closed book written test in a while. But then closed-book tests are more helpful retaining the concepts. For both tests - I studied for 3 days straight and took exam at the end of 3rd day - 3 days were enough. \n\nVideos are good and helpful. Extra readings are boring and elaborate - but you don't need to read everything - you need to focus on key concepts. \n\nOffice hours were useful and I spent time watching all of them offline. The discussions in office hours will give you tips for your projects and help u out with key concepts on tests. \n\nGood course overall - definitely recommended. The only concern is that you are more worried about loosing the points than earning points. ",

Trying to learn those skills while taking this course won't work at all. To be honest, the instructor clearly explains that, and gives a fair warning on the first week of class. Trying to do that would be like trying to learn Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the same time (as someone recently mentioned). \n\nThe instructor and TA seem very involved in improving the experience for all students. New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's. So that really makes a difference. \n\nIt was mentioned that there will be further enhancements to this course next term. Something else: do try to take advantage of every extra credit opportunity (if given). \n\nI definitely can say that I learned A LOT. There where weeks were I spent my weekdays after office 8pm-1am, and weekends all day long reading, working on homework, watching lectures from other universities. Take advantage of the instructor/TA's! Don't be afraid of asking any question about the material, I don't remember a question left unanswered. ",

Not only that, I have taken 6 courses so far and I consider this class the worse of all. Granted, it was the first time this course was offered in this program. However, there are things that should have been taken care of by a professor who has tough the subject before. To start with, we did not have a syllabus. The one provided by the teacher was a very high level organization of the course, which did not help much. We, students were the ones who put together a syllabus. The organization of the course was terrible as well. We had 4 exams. The first two covered easy material with plenty of time. The last two covered much more difficult material with less time to study it. Many questions on the open-book tests were written in a convoluted manner, so difficult to understand that even the professor gave the wrong answers to the TAs consistently in the first 3 tests for about 10% of the questions. \n\nEach exam had 25 questions worth 1 point each but, at the end, the exam grade was multiplied by 4. Many questions covered more than one knowledge item so if you missed one of the concepts you would still have the whole question wrong. \n\nYou need to start early studying for exams. Once the exam period starts (and I'm not talking about the actual exam), we were not allowed to ask any questions regarding the subjects covered on the test, which I thought was an unfortunate and ill-advised rule. \n\nThe TAs were very helpful and questions were answered right away. In addition, many of the students taking the class had advanced DB knowledge and were eager to help in Piazza. \n\nThe subject was very interesting and a must (the subject of DBs) for any student on this program.

Beware if you have a different thought than what's accepted!\nThe word count in the assignments is a lie. You need to double or triple it, add about six or seven diagrams and probably some pseudo-code.

I didn't feel like I was learning anything and so I didn't even know what I could write about. \nI didn't like Dr. Goel. He didn't seem respectful of the fact that I was having difficulty understanding what the requirements were. I felt like I was guessing, and he would just disagree when I attempted an idea (but not give me any clues as to how to continue).

This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric. ",

It was madness!

It surprised me how I never got fed up with the jokes. I guess I always find a true nerd's humor amusing. \n\nI'd like to invite everyone to give HPC a chance. The fact that it's not required for a specialization (anymore :'S) shouldn't mean it's not worth the effort. This class is the bomb! It's packed with algorithm design and analysis (and very clever algorithms, by the way), several models of computation that you may not have studied before, and probably should, oh and the projects are spectacular. If you like algorithms, programming, getting your mind blown, and are up for a challenge, this class is for you. It's hands-on Computer Science in my opinion. \n\nThere are some requirements that I'll try and emphasize here:\n - Running time and complexity analysis, Big O and Theta notation, the master method, etc. \n - C and C++. You gotta know how to code in these languages. I mean know them well. If you're afraid of pointers, you should get some practice first. \n - Basic Linux command line knowledge, as projects involve a virtual machine and the Deepthought Cluster. \n - Some linear algebra, as in virtually any other class. \n - C and C++. Yes, you need to be able to get an algorithm from a lecture or an academic paper down to functional C/C++ code. \n - Debugging in the woods with your teeth and a knife. \n\nGive it a shot, You'll have fun!",

I personally do not care about the Relational Algebra or some other theoretical stuff, but I do care about practical skills that I can put into use in industry. \nI like the layout of this course given a hands-on project is included. The project mimics a real-world request from an IT company's imaginative client --- Students were required to form a group of 4 and the eventual goal is to design both a DB and a web interface ( something like a php UI) for a tool rental company's employees to look up/update the DB. Very interesting! \n\nNevertheless, I don't really agree with the course creator on the grading breakdown. The four exams accounted for too much of a percentage (15% each), while the final phase of the course project took us 20+hours per week but it accounted for merely 10%. Also a few exam questions were kind of controversial. ",

All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own). \n\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning. \nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading. \nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points. \n\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome! One or two of the TA's are also fairly engaged but the rest generally don't help out on Piazza. \n\nMake sure you watch the schedule carefully. Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced. However, messing up one assignment, especially from something silly like using a disallowed library or not making sure it works in the grading environment can cost you a lot, possibly even a letter grade for a big assignment. \n\nOne problem with the class when I took it was that the assignments were not finalized in advance, and sometimes not even until a couple days before the due date. Not only does this interfere with working ahead but having the requirements get changed after you already submitted is rather annoying. ",

My experience on project was very positive and I felt like I was really in school having a weekly hangout meeting with colleagues. \n\nOpportunity for improvement I felt was the lead time for assignment grades and opportunities to practice white box and black box testings.

I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn't like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each.

If you are completely unfamiliar with C i recommend taking a quick refresher. The projects were very challenging but I feel I really learned a lot while completing them. Even though the project were challenging, the slides provided enough information most of the time for you to get started and use google to figure out the rest. \n\nExams: Standard proctored exams that cover a specific set of material. Not cumulative. As long as you study you will do fine. \n\nGrading: Grading was extremely fair i thought. A lot of the projects used a \"unit test\" method through Udacity and the results of those tests gave you a pretty good understanding of what grade to expect. Final grade was curved. \n\nOverall: Great class but very challenging. Do not take this with another class unless you have a lot of time on your hands. ",

I've taken a few other classes before and they all had a major disconnect between lectures and assignments -- the lectures were very thin compared to what was expected and a lot of self researching was needed. Dr. Bobick really does care about teaching this subject and wants you to understand and appreciate it fully and this shows easily in his lectures, which are formatted logically and are exhaustive (well, atleast for an intro course.. ). The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned. \n\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results. It does get a bit math intensive towards the middle and latter part of the course so brushing up on your linear algebra would go a long way. The final was open-book and was quite easy and straightforward sticking to higher level questions than mundane specifics. \n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this class to bits and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to dive into this wonderful and nascent field!",

Basic knowledge of C. Received an A in the course. \n\nLectures are well done. However, the projects go over only several of the topics covered in lecture. Resist the temptation to save all of the lectures for later. \n\nProjects are done in C. Skeleton code is given, but a lot of thought needs to be put into how your implementation can play nice with the pre-written code. Also, a lot of time is spent wrangling with the autograder; sometimes the autograder doesn't provide any meaningful or consistent output. Projects are judged against several test cases; a difficult point for me was anticipating some of these test cases, but the project rubric and other people's questions and answers on Piazza gave helpful hints on what cases to anticipate. \n\nSpeaking of Piazza, questions are answered quickly, either by students, or the TA/the professor. Office hours are also consistent. \n\nNumber of hours spent: I had to work during lunches (every day during weeks when projects were due or an exam was being held), and an hour or two after work if I'm not already wiped out. Also had to devote several hours on weekends for projects and studying for exams. \n\nOverall, a very solid and straightforward class. There aren't any tricks or gotchas in my opinion, and results will accurately reflect the amount of work you put in. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. ",

The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.

When there were no projects released or assignments due, I would typically spend only a few hours a week. When a project was due, I would spend closer to 20 hours a week. I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid. \n\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches. ",

You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment. ",

I tried my best to be fair & hopefully it helps others. I got a B in this class. \n\nContent: Videos are highly analytic & professor often uses “so” & “therefore” to skip explaining a concept. I took this class under the impression that it’s related to the standard testing/QA but it was mostly about compiler design/efficiency. Video lectures quality is overall low especially towards the end. \nPre-requisites: Pre-reqs were removed from the course page later on. You need to be proficient in Java, C, discrete math …\nExams: I’ll summarize it with this epic story: Instructor posted a pdf with sample questions prior to the midterm & based on the comments on Piazza, majority of the class simply thought that he posted the wrong pdf or in the wrong class. Average for the midterm exam was in mid-50. Hopefully you can understand the gap here\nAssignments: They are written in a very dense academic format. Professor & the TAs weren’t helpful in explaining the assignment, providing resources or answering Piazza questions. They run a plagiarism program over all the assignments & you can end up at the dean office or get an F if they find you plagiarized. \nPiazza: Professor & TAs are very detached from Piazza but you see lots of helpful comment from the top 5% of the class. Anon post are not allowed. \nProfessor/TA: In a nutshell I think I’d have enjoyed this class a lot more if we had an active/engaged, professional & experienced professor. The staff was not open to any suggestion or feedback. I felt they were very much used to the on-campus traditional style of teaching & communication with students. Professor Mayur only showed up to say the harsh words or threaten students. Before finals week he sent a mass email saying: “I find that you plagiarized in this assignment while grading, the consequences will be severe: an F grade in this entire course. ”",

There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the ‘optional’ office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don’t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.

The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones.

The lectures could be improved to cover more materials required to complete the assignments as well as super important in any AI course (for example, Markov Chain); I have spent considerable amount of time learning concepts from outside source (online academic source, somewhat ironically) to complete assignments. This truly feels like a GT graduate level course where the expectation from students is a bit high. After completing this course I think I can better understand the AI zeitgeist and actually comprehend the technical discussion around AI. ",

Worse yet, they do not help with the homework. \n\nI'm very interested in this material but ended up dropping the class as I don't believe it is being taught in a helpful manner. Though changes were made from Fall 2015, the changes are for the worse and only resulting in more of a time suck than anything else. \n\nThere is a Readiness Assessment that is provided after adding the class. It really needs to be posted on the official OMS site so that people have an idea about what this class will be like. \n\nYou need to handwrite and scan in your homework. \n\nVery poorly taught (or really not taught at all).

The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. \nThe lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You're on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you'd like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don't even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you've taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you've read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. \nWritten assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn't, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. \nThe coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is 'learning by recording cases' and those if conditionals are 'decision trees' or whatever. \nSo all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you're not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend. Rest of it is up to you. ",

            "text": "Reviewing near the end of the course. Great course that focuses on how classic CS concepts like graph theory can be practically applied by tailoring software for embedded systems. \n\nThis class isn't a hardware course, nor is it a course on how to write software for an embedded system. It's a class on how software is manipulated to run efficiently on power, hardware, and size limited devices. \n\nIt covers:\nembedded system instruction set architectures\nhardware support \ninstruction level parallelism\npipelining\nand compiler optimizations that take regular code and compile it such that it can run on embedded systems. \n\nThe course was condensed for summer but I think we still covered the same material. We had 4 homework assignments (initially 5), each taking about 5-15 hours to complete over 2 weeks. There was one project, taking about 20-25 hours to complete over a moth. There were also homework assignments due during this time. I think the full semester may have two projects, and two more homeworks that were smaller. \n\nThere was a proctored midterm and will be a proctored final, the midterm took an hour to complete (you get two hours). The level of difficulty was on par with the homework, but the test is closed notes. \n\nIn the condensed semester there were 2 lectures series and a reading per week for the first half, dropping to one of each after the midterm. The hardest thing to keep up with is covering the material in order to do the homeworks and take the tests, I recommend watching at 1. 25 speed due to reduce time spent. \n\nThe project and one homework were C++ programs. You can do this in your own environment, but you will run some code on GT's deepthought cluster via SSH. There's no GUI, but all you need are basic Linux commands. The assignments were straightforward implementations of concepts from the lectures/readings. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course. If you are taking CCA, this course will apply some of the Graph theory concepts covered there. ",

It's somewhat more difficult, but that's not saying much. \n\nGrading consists of two rote memorization exams (easy), a lot of open book quizzes (which themselves appear to be plagiarized from Quizlet, so you know.. google them), and some projects (moderate difficulty). \n\nThe lectures are okay, if boring. I really can't complain about them. \n\nThe projects are really only a challenge whenever the questions are ambiguous, nonsense, or rewritten by the TAs after release (formally or informally on Piazza via \"clarifications\"). \n\nTAs are not very responsive on the forums, from what I've seen. \n\nThis course does not meet my expectations for this program. It's certainly not on the same level as the CV, RLDM, ML, or CCA, etc. On the other hand, if you find yourself out of interesting courses to take and want to just finish the program, here's an easy A.

However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned. ",

            "text": "This course is NOT an introduction to embedded software, it is a graduate level course in Embedded Computing with sole focus on pipe lined architectures like VLIW. Most of the assignments are related to compiler optimization and scheduling. The video course material is riddled with errors and inconsistencies, explanations of topics are pretty weak and assignments come in verbose long paragraphs of text walls which also have some errors in them. So to do any assignments the best thing is to wait it out on Piazza and have all the questions answered before you begin to solve one. The best way i found to go about this course is to ONLY read the text book and do one of the many other compiler lectures (from CMU online) to understand the text. They should really throw away all the material they have created and make a new one. Honestly, this is one course you can absolutely do without (or you can audit in your spare time if you wish) not because of the course content but the haphazard way of delivering content mired with errors. \n\nThe grading is lenient so at least that is a positive and once you cut through the clutter, the course material is moderate difficulty.

            "text": "This course - at its core - teaches two things:\n\n1) the syntax and conventions of UML diagrams: class, sequence, state chart make up the major players. Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.

This has led to some confusion around the extra credit assignment grading, but hopefully things will run more smoothly next Summer. \n\nAs per other reviews below, we are now required to complete all 4 assignments. They ranged from straightforward to tedious due to the wide range of skills needed. For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a 'bonus' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set. \n\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes. \n\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration. It fills that requirement nicely. ",

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue. ",

I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning. ",

A full semester later, I can probably summarize what I learned in this course in just a few pages. \n\nThe lectures and assignments were structured in a way that reminded me of a 100 level course I took in my undergrad. The lectures were very high level, and the assignments required us to write about vague AI based solutions to known problems without getting into any implementation. The project was fun and challenging, but I didn't need any of the knowledge I learnt from the course. \n\nOverall, take the course if you'll be satisfied with a very basic introduction to AI, or if you want an easy A.

The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.

            "text": "This is my second OMSCS course. This course focuses on the process of human cognition and methodologies to design artificial intelligence to imitate human cognition. This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 …. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment. ",

I would say the course is very well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are very engaged , and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you in the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. \nI am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with picking up C. I believe, this is the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (trust me, I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher myself in a European university before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\" :)\n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course. ",

The exams are a midterm and final, and the final is not cumulative. \n\nThe projects: These took me from 6 to 12 hours each. The projects were:\n1. Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other. \n\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn. The class average for the first exam was an 80. I'm writing this before getting the results of the final exam. \n\nBonus project: the professors graciously allowed us a 10% extra credit project. Do it - it's fire insurance against a bad exam performance and can almost guarantee you the A. \n\nFinal verdict: this class was fun, and I learned a lot.

The tests did not cover anything that wasn't in the lectures/homework/papers, but they covered a vast amount of content. Take good notes on the lectures AND study them and you should be fine. \n\nHomeworks: The homeworks are optional but not optional if you want to do well on the tests. \n\nPapers: There were several academic papers for us to read. They varied in difficulty, but a couple of them were very long. However, the tests and the projects didn't seem to test our knowledge of them very extensively (other than what was in the homeworks). \n\nLectures: These are good, but they are not very consistent in the amount of detail covered. Some topics are covered in much detail while others are not. It would be nice if each one had optional readings associated with them.

Project #1 (overflows) and Project #4 (web vulnerabilities). \n\n4) You get the opportunity for extra credit via an optional project that expands on one of the \"official\" projects. \n\nNow unfortunately the things I didn't like:\n\n1) I can't say this strongly enough, \"logistics\". I get this is a summer course so everything is condensed, but there were problems across the board regarding issues with projects and issues with autograders. The \"optional\" project grading policy was changed no less than 3 times within a week of the end of the semester. \n\n2) Get ready for some quizzes with \"subjective\" or \"ambiguous\" true/false questions. Good luck arguing them. They'll say not to read into them too much; but then come back at your challenge with some convoluted worded reasoning why you're wrong. \n\n3) The book is absolutely tedious to read. The authors need to understand the concept of \"run on\" sentences. \n\n4) Grades on practically EVERYTHING were held up because someone was suspected of cheating. \n\n5) Some of the projects seemed like straight busy work (cough Project #2). \n\n6) Some of the projects seemed like they added extraneous stuff just to make our life harder (cough Project #3). \n\n7) They'll crackdown on cheating, but let students ask questions on Piazza that practically go through step by step what to do. Seriously. Wait till a day or two before the projects are due and just read through Piazza and you won't need to do any work. This has got to be the biggest \"nope\" for me. I think it demeans the value of the program when people no longer have to try or even research on their own. ",

Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution. ",

Provides a decent overview of computer security concepts, but doesn't dive into most of them very deeply. \n\nLectures:\nSome of the lectures are quite long. Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I've had so far, but not terrible either. \n\nHomework:\nThere's a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it's best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit. \n\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade. \n\nTests\nTests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn't take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThe TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days. \n\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects. \n\nBook:\nThe textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst. You _might_ be able to get by without the textbook here, but it was extremely useful in studying for tests and quizzes. \n\nConclusion:\nWorth taking if you're looking for a summer class and don't have broad knowledge of information security concepts.

There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research. ",

While I didn't find coursework to be all that challenging, it was time consuming. Dr. Joyner does a wonderful job of managing the class and communicating via Piazza. The lectures are informative and thought-provoking, but there's not a whole lot of depth. Perhaps the suggested readings were intended to supply the depth, but I didn't find them necessary for success in the course. Similar to what a few other reviewers have posted, my biggest complaint about this course was that I didn't feel like I applied the lecture topics to the projects. I'm fairly confident I would have implemented my agent in the exact same way without having watched any of the lectures. ",

Gavrilovska is a published OS researcher, so knows the material intimately. TAs were incredibly helpful on Piazza with quick replies and knowledgeable (Tony Mason completely rocked it). \n\nThe only complaint I would have is that the Udacity autograder was configured to execute code that was different from what we were provided to test in local VMs, so several times I found myself ripping my hair out trying to figure out why some client-server test was timing out on Udacity after 10s but completing in milliseconds on my local VM. It seems the TAs love to set up network partition errors for client-server tests. You know who you are... ;)\n\nOverall great course, got more in-depth OS knowledge than I came into it with, and feel like it was one of the best-organized courses I've taken so far (3rd in the program).

The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions. All because of highly weighted exams that were regularly regraded because the answer keys were wrong or in some cases the questions didn't even have clear right answers at all. ",

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it. ",

In project work, visual approach is mandatory by the end and it involves mostly ad-hoc heuristics for RPM problems rather than any widely applicable AI algorithms.

On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia. You may have a bad trip. \n\nThat said this class is not really the monster it is made out to be. Complaints about it being too mathy or taught by a math professor are misguided. It is very mathy and you should accept that for a theoretical computer science course. For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck. ",

This is partly a factor of the reduced term period, but also because I also spent a lot of extra hours on Above & Beyond work for the homeworks just because I got obsessed and was having fun. If you restrain your enthusiasm then you will reduce your workload by a large amount. On the other hand I think putting in the extra time will help you get more out of it because the base parts of all the homework assignments are pretty easy and simple. \n\nWhile the material and base assignments were pretty simple, this summer the assignments were being reworked for autograding which meant they were not released in advance, so it made dealing with summer travel more difficult as we had about 2 assignments due each week for the first two months of the course. The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won't be a problem). \n\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material. However in the 6th and 7th lecture modules of the course they cover more specialized topics that were interesting and for the \"8th\" module we were given a collection of 6 academic papers to read. Reading those were my favorite section of the course and I highly recommend reading them early as they give some good ideas for final projects. Like the above & beyond work, you will get more from the class if you challenge yourself on the final project - that gives you a chance to go deep into an interesting area of your choice. Be creative. ",

I will admit that I have no prior experience in robotics and I felt that I will learn the concept along the way. The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either. \n I just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B’s and C’s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn’t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. ) \n If you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course. (No please don’t fall for we will consider hardware and software challenges if you are in between grades. There were 5 software challenges and 4 hardware challenges and if you do them all , they will account for 1 mark. ). Stay away or learn all maths before hand. ",

Going into the class I considered myself a 'novice' in C and 'intermediate' in a couple other languages (I didn't graduate as CS undergrad). The first project is estimated to take ~30 hours, and it took me 70 hours. The next two took me ~45 and ~25, respectively. I'd say if you are already proficient in programming in C or have the time to make yourself proficient, this class is definitely worth the effort. \n\nAlso, Prof Ada, the TAs, and my classmates were all very active and very helpful on Piazza. Prof Ada held office hours every week via Hangouts On Air, so they could be reviewed on YouTube at your convenience. Very engaged staff that really want to see you succeed, regardless of your familiarity with C / Linux stuff.",

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block. \n\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable. \n\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures. ",

As always, start everything early. There were two projects and a single (final) exam over the summer, but I understand the 'regular' semesters have had a 3rd project and an extra exam. New developments for the summer: The class was language agnostic and you didn't have to submit code... just auto-graded for the weekly assignments. No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule. I'd say it's a must-take if you're interested in RL. There's a ton of reading, though, and the lectures are fairly dense... not a class you can run the videos on 2x the first time through!",

If you watch the lectures and read the book, it is very easy to get 100% for the quizzes. \n\nProjects: The projects are fun, and help to understand and appreciate the topics better. Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security.

So if you have never built a webpage and used a bit of javascript, you should look into that some. Please don't ignore Piazza no matter how smart you are. The TA's will clarify inconsistencies between the required text and the Udacity lectures and will remove confusion about quiz questions and assignments. You'll probably kick yourself if you miss questions and parts of assignments just because you missed a good Piazza post. ",

All assignments except panorama and HDR require very simple python programming. If you are new to numpy, just brush up on some basic numpy tutorials. There are 11 assignments, 1 final project and 1 final exam. 9/11 assignments and the final project have 10 points for above and beyond and the course has absolute grading [no curves]. So, if you want an A then you should have 90+ in all assignments, final project and the exam. Modules 6, 7 and additional reading in module 8 cover very cool, useful and advanced topics and watching/reading them early will give good ideas for the final project. Also, please take notes while watching the lectures because without the notes, it is very difficult to get high marks in the final exam. ",

The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge. In addition, at least for this summer term, we were presented with the full workload from an academic term in the compressed summer timeframe, meaning most of the 11 assignments were given two at a time (and not in advance. ) In some cases, changes were still being made to assignments days before they were due. \n\nThe course material itself is fascinating; I really enjoyed everything we learned about, and in retrospect would have preferred taking this course in a full term to really be able to dig into the material, instead of just finishing up assignment after assignment. The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students. The confusion, stupid fast workload and angst all made what should have been an enjoyable survey course one of my least favorite in the program as far as organizational issues went. That said, I greatly value everything I learned in that class, and will take a risk on taking CV with the same instructor -- during a regular term! -- solely because of what I learned there.",

He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed.

Also, you're gonna need a good team for the project. By good I'm not talking about dev-savvy (though it helps). Good in this context means good communicators and overall team members. I had a fantastic team where we could depending on each other and split work appropriately. At the end of the day though, I have a tad bit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of a few assignments and some grading that I didn't agree with 100% (and I'm not the complaining type for this stuff).

Unfortunately the multiple choice questions are very nit picking and almost all are a variation of \"choose all correct answers\" with a few ambiguous options that could be interpreted either way. \n\nTime is heavily weighted toward the final project and exam at the end of the semester (20+ hours per week). The lectures and assignments earlier in the term are closer to 5-10 hours per week.",

I'd say this is a good course to pair with another one, it has a medium load. Also I think this would be a very nice introduction to ML topics. Basic calculus/probability concepts are needed for the second part of the course. \n\nHomework and projects feature open ended questions, where you explain/justify your answers (report) and also provide the R code you wrote to justify your analysis (tables, plots, etc). It's also helpful if you already have experience writing \"vectorized code\" (like in Matlab, Python with Numpy/Pandas, etc). \n\nSyllabus:\n\n- R programming (most of the course will be in R)\n- data visualization\n- data processing\n- logistic regression\n- linear regression\n- high dimensions and regularization\n \nEach one of those \"chapters\" is covered in two weeks, so typically in that lapse of time you watch the lectures and work on the homework/project associated with that chapter. \n\nGrading: \nThe course features three assignments, an individual project (divided in a midterm project, and final project), and a final (open book, not multiple choice) exam with the grade distributed equally between these components (33% all hw, 33% project, 33% exam). \"",

It took me 30-40 hours (sometimes as many as 50) hours per week for the rest of the semester to pull my grade up to a B by the end. In the end, I actually had a C but on the final I had answered a question correctly, but not the way he wanted me to and eventually he allowed that I had not only answered it correctly but has proved my answer and so he gave me full credit (I couldn't argue for partial credit) for the question and I got to a B. \n\nThe lectures need to be redone and I think they really need to think about how they have structured the course.",

As I write this review, we're only 10 weeks in the course. \n\nI have a BS in CS, and this makes me familiar with some topics in HCI, such as Usability. I'd say it is an intro to the broad field of HCI. There is no prerequisite for CS 6750, and you'll be perfectly fine with a different background. \n\nThe workload is very light at 15 h/w, more or less. There is one written assignment each week, which consists of four questions, and each should be answered with up to 300 words. Answering the questions requires watching weekly lectures, and reflecting on their objectives. These assignments are publicly available at: http://omscs6750. gatech. edu/fall-2016/full-course-calendar/\n\nCS6750 is very different from code-intensive courses that have coding assignment (e. g. CS 6300 SDP). In HCI, you will describe and analyze user interfaces. I think everyone that designs computerized products should take this course. It gives you a different perspective to look at your tasks, and the interface you use to achieve your goals. \n\nThe Video Lectures are not publicly available, but you can view the Scripts at: https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/0B1-VjNQe61hsYi1YanNYYzdkd3c\n\nIn addition to weekly assignments, there are two exams that should be taken via Proctortrack. These exams are open-note; which means you may watch the lectures as you answer the exams, or review your notes. \n\nFacts:\nNo required textbook or readings. \nNo coding assignments. \nGrades are not curved ( B >= 80, A >= 90 ). \nInstructor is very active in Piazza. \n\nHCI should be perfect for Summer. It can also be combined with another course with Low-to-Medium workload.",

You write code to exploit a fictitious website and also write a Chrome plugin to guard against certain exploits. I found this assignment quite fun. \n\nThe second assignment involves running malware on a VM and examining how it behaves. The entire assignment can probably be done in a single (multi-hour) session. It was quite easy and somewhat interesting. \n\nThe third assignment involves writing IPS/IDS rules using snort to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. This asignment was the most difficult for me and it seemed to cause issues for others as well. Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules \"with a long shelf life\". There was some comedy here when some of the \"benign\" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended. \n\nThe last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing an algorithm that was laid out in an academic paper. \n\nThis class is a decent option to fill a Computing Systems concentration requirement.",

I agree with most of the other comments mentioned: workload is do-able (plan at least 12-15 hours a week, as the projects take far longer than you will anticipate), there is roughly 9 hours of video total, and the instructor is very active and very reasonable. \n\nThe only thing I will say differently is the math, at least for the last homework, was challenging for someone rusty in partial derivatives. Fortunately this part of the homework is the only homework / project that you actively need a math skillset; fortunately the instructor is very lenient on discussing the math section, to the point where a legendary student (who is also a math professor) walked the class through most of the problem and there was no complaint from the instructor. I will say brush up on Calculus (particularly derivatives, partial derivatives, and the chain rule), Probability, and basic Linear Algebra and you should be fine.",

I myself had no prior experience and really wanted to apply myself so that I can properly internalize the core concepts and found myself working around 20 hours a week. However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him. Hes got some great experience in ML and does a good job of breaking down the concepts into digestible chunks. \n\nFinal takeaway is to definitely take this class if you are in the ML track but if you are already quite proficient in ML and R, this class may not give you anything more.",

For those who are concerned about the amount of time the class consumes, those times are mostly based on students satisfying all project requirements, studying to do well on the exams, and completing the extra credit. If the curve is consistent from semester to semester, you can probably cut quite a few corners and still get an 'A'; if you are only shooting for a 'B' you can do even less (do so at your own risk!). \n\nNote: The structure of this class is learn about an abstract OS concept and then develop an application that uses that linux implementation of that OS concept. For example: learn about threading -> implement a program that uses linux pthreads. This is not a class where you have to implement the OS construct (I think that is reserved for AOS).",

You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault.

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.",

I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

Also, you learn about test driven development which is a useful thing to know. Android development in this class is not that difficult. For the first android assignment, you practically follow a tutorial by the instructor with minor changes. For the group project, you will also use android but it is not that difficult as well. You will need to know how to integrate databases in your app as well as how to navigate through views in android. Other assignments are not bad and can be completed comfortably within 2 days. The instructor and TAs are involved and quite active on Piazza and generally do a good job in answering questions and clarifications.",

For a graduate level course, it's really uncalled for and, outside of a kindergarten classroom, not conducive to learning. \n\nAssignments were a mess, with deadlines sometimes jumping, but always being very short (sometimes in the course of less than 4 days). If you are expecting a class where you can get caught up on weekends, this is not the course to take. It also didn't help for early assignments that the FHIR server used for the class would get overloaded, especially on weekends, preventing students from getting work done. \n\nTack on to that \"engagement\" exercises that were really more like busy work. If you like taking HR engagement surveys, there will be quite a few of them in this course. You also need to provide weekly status updates (which aren't too bad). These aren't as much of a hassle once you've gotten through all the lectures, but it's a pain to juggle early on in the course. \n\nI'm not surprised this course is not being offered in the near future - logistically it is a nightmare, and with the new presidential administration, healthcare in the US will be changing.

The problems were mainly with pacing of the course and specifics with the project details. There were many dead spots throughout the semester and the projects had evolving instructions / descriptions. I expect these issues to be worked out in subsequent semesters. For those who have taken InfoSec, This course is VERY similar. \n\nLots of opportunities for extra credit, some of the projects are reminiscent of Info Sec as well. The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project. \n\nProjects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python). \n\nThe slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem. \n\nThere is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job. \n\nOverall I would recommend taking the class.

Only a few hours of work a week. \n\nLike others mentioned there are only 4 projects that make up your grade. They are not too difficult and do not take up much time. The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension. \n\nThe second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets. \n\nThe third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each. \n\nThe fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it. \n\nWe had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities. \n\nIf you liked the IT Security class you will like this one. The professor and TA’s were very helpful. It is very similar in workload and content and very easy. I haven’t got my final grade but I would guess ending up near 105% with the extra credit.",

It has some issues, but fortunately they are ones I think will be resolved in future iterations of the course. \n\nThe course stands alone very well, and covers the necessary background material needed to be successful without needing to take other classes. If you have taken CN, InfoSec, and NetSec, you will find much of the material to be review. What is unique to this class is how this pertains to the realm of cyber physical systems like Programmable Logic Controllers, and how these devices are used in a conventional industrial plant. \n\nThis semester the course had 3 projects, each taking between 5-8 hours to complete. Each focused on it's own area - Ladder Logic Programming, Industrial Protocols, and exploiting vulnerabilities in CPS. There was a one hour midterm consisting of multiple choice and T/F style problems. I have yet to take the final, but it is 3 hours long, has a similar format and length to the midterm, and is comprehensive. We are permitted to use a single sheet of notes for the tests. \n\nThe material spends a lot of time focusing on definitions of terms, policies, and best practices. It uses common terminology, so much of it will be familiar, just applied to a new realm. The videos are high quality, easy to understand, and you can tell Professor Beyah was well rehearsed and polished for their production. There are a few moments where I felt like I was watching the Turbo Encabulator video, but it wasn't too terribly distracting. \n\nThe course also has some pacing issues. With only three short projects, straightforward material, two tests, and ~50 students this semester we probably won't get higher than 300 threads in Piazza. I think the inclusion of meatier projects / more projects is likely to occur, and would benefit the class. \n\nIf you are looking to prepare for the course, you could learn Wireshark if you don't already know how to use it, and potentially buy the books in advance and do some casual reading.",

I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.",

Almost all the TA's were highly motivated, fun to work with on assignments & were highly responsive on piazza (sometimes even on holidays) & the best part was they are all humble enough to learn from any occasional mistakes that happened in setting up assignments or questions in the exams. \nThe course is pretty loaded (especially if you are working fulltime).

Anything over the overall course mean was an A, and the B cutoff was generously below the mean. \n\nThe lectures are a patchwork of old content from Thrun and Norvig and some new modules with Starner; production value is good, but the new content is often superficial, and it seems to be read from a script.

Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not. \n\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn't always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems. I think the Bonnie servers are Udacity infrastructure shared by all GT classes that use the system, so large classes (6601 started with 400+ this term) and overlapping deadlines cause issues. \n\nGive it another couple semesters to work out the bugs before taking this one.",

Based off the reviews, I was expecting a really easy class that was a pain in the ass regarding quizzes. \n\nGuess what? Someone reads reviews. The quizzes are gone, but now the projects have a little bit more meat to them. The exams aren't terrible, but require you to actually do the reading (that's not a bad thing... ) and watch the lectures. \n\nMy only real complaint is it seems like some of the projects were in flight or being modified as we went. The last one was delayed due to issues for example and ended up being replaced. \n\nOverall I'd take this class. If you've had no exposure to Python (like me), it's a good way to get your feet wet. If you've had no programming experience at all? Some of the projects may be just a tad stressful.",

I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired. It was all very interesting content to me, but it felt a bit shallow. \n\nI selected 6 hrs/week as an estimated average. Some weeks were heavier than others, and then there were weeks when I didn't really do much at all. The course was pretty easy, in my opinion.",

There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",

If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this class. As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb.",

Some lectures seem to be re-used Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun videos that are nearly unwatchable and not remotely on par with other OMSCS classes. \n\nThere are definitely some bright spots in the course and I could see this being a strong offering later on if they refine/replace a lot of the older and poorly quality controlled content. Assignments were relevant to the course material and did a good job pushing you to learn the material thoroughly. Some assignments even had auto-graders which I appreciated because you could roughly know your grade on the assignment before the submission deadline. To their credit, the TAs were also fairly responsive and willing to admit and correct unclear areas of assignments and exams almost to a fault. \n\nOverall I would still recommend this course as a good first A.

I agree with this but it wasn't a major headache as I've had similar experiences with other classes. Just know what you're getting into. \nThe APIs are difficult to get set up.

            "text": "Coming into the course I had about 4 years of professional development experience, mostly in C# and Python, but also some experience in C in undergrad and some professionally (programming micro-controllers). I don't have a CS degree so had never taken an OS course. This was also my first course in the program. \n\nThe class is extremely well run. The TAs are very active and helpful, and both Piazza and Slack are active and great resources. The lectures are thorough, well done, interesting, and generally translate well to the material needed for the exams. The projects (with the possible exception of project 2) are well done and very helpful to understanding concepts. \n\nThe style of the exams was multiple-guess and fill in the blank, timed, proctored (ProctorTrack), taken through T-Square. The questions needed some improvement, though. Some of the questions are a bit nit-picky, and some are written in such a way that I spent more time debating the intent of the question than figuring out the answer. \n\nAs for workload, the projects consumed most of the time I spent on the course. When I was working on a project I might spend 20+ hours a week on the class. Otherwise it was less than 10. To be successful on the projects I'd recommend starting early, being comfortable writing C in a \nLinux environment, using the command line, and debugging with GDB. \n\nLast, don't cheat. One of the TAs mentioned that they caught something like 10% of our class cheating on the projects. That's ridiculous. Start early, keep at it, and hit the Slack channel when you get stuck. You can survive a bad grade on a project but a course F due to cheating might end your time in the program. Don't be dumb.",

The lectures are a combination of old videos by Norvig/Thrun and new content by Thad Starner and head TA Shelly Baghi. The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book. They each took about 10 hours to complete and motivated you to consult the book/lectures to fully understand the topics before committing to an answer. \n\nOn average I spent about 10 hours per week on the class (counted by Toggl) but by no means it's an easy class. Unless you're a skilled programmer and used to watching lectures at 2x speed, you could easily end up needing twice as much.",

You can submit the projects as many times as you would like before the deadline, and there are automated tests written for each project that give you immediate feedback on each submission. The projects deal with topics such as synchronization, multithreading, remote procedure calls, and different forms of interprocess communication.

Even if you remember all of the material, you have to be able to understand it and apply it in new ways on the exam. The questions are either multiple choice, check all that apply, or fill in the blank.

Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions.

I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well.

The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many. It's unfortunate that so much of their time and effort had to go into something that shouldn't happen, instead of on grading and improving projects. Be a considerate person, don't cheat.",

With two lecturers listed as being in charge of this course, you would think that one of them take the lead and run the show. As it turned out, however, neither of them seemed to be particularly interested in putting in any more than the bare minimum amount of effort and the whole course was more or less run by the two teaching assistants. The end result was one of the deadest courses I have taken in this entire program. This might not have been so bad, except for the fact that the two major projects for this course don't really match what has been taught in the lecture videos. That means that in order to actually get through the projects, you pretty much have to go out and learn some pretty difficult material by yourself without any instructor support. With better instructors and projects that better mapped to the lectures, this could have been a really great course. As it is, I would steer clear unless you're looking for a course with a relatively low time commitment to pair with something harder and don't really care too much about learning anything.",

            "text": "Overall: I think this course should be mandatory for those of us without a CS bachelor's degree. I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor.",

It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class.",

The assignments were mostly practical and allow for proficiency with a bunch of development tools. Programming is in java, and db experience helped a lot with the group project. Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

They probably have no programming experience as well but it does not change the fact that many projects are really not about the programming itself, all programming language uses in the course projects are basic. It is more about the course contexts rather than some language gimmicks. What I really like as well as other courses is that by studying the tests, I am forced to learn the concepts in depth, not just recognize the terms. You have to write essay answers in tests.

I mean real understanding of what matrices are, not just knowing the definitions or tricks to solve them. You will love professor Bobick and his humor during the lectures. His lectures were very useful to simplify things, and you won't appreciate his excellent explanation unless you try to read a CV book.

In my opinion, this reflects the success of this course generally. If anyone want to take this course, then prepare yourself with enough Python knowledge and linear algebra since you will need them. Also, start any problem set as soon as you can and always check Piazza and slack group since you will find great community who will help and encourage you.

In general, way too many video lectures and content to cover in a single semester. \n\nI think shrinking the videos used for the course by 20% would be more fitting given the length of a semester. Great introduction to computer vision, but doesn't go into depth into anything. \n\nThe final is strange as the assignments don't really prep for some of the details required to get a good grade. \n\nI don't think the Peer Feedback component of the course helps at all, never read the feedback people gave me. \n\nThe Prof is completely hands off, letting the TAs run the course.

The course covers a ton of material, and only had two exams (second was comprehensive) which made the amount of material to study for both quite staggering, and there were tons of quizzes and problem sets that were picky about rounding/formatting. Office hours weren't recorded for some reason when they were held, and the majority of grades weren't released until after the final was over making it hard to gauge one's progress. The SESC code base used throughout the class is horrific coming from someone who has worked in enterprise for a few years, and sadly the majority of the projects were spent just figuring out what was going on in the code vs. actually implementing and having fun measuring different aspects of the project questions. One project involved modifying the simulator in a file where ~20-30 lines of code directly pertinent to the project didn't even work correctly, and was effectively dead code that misled students. Luckily the main active TA Nolan was awesome, super-responsive to questions and helped clarify a lot of the confusion over Piazza. All lectures were just on a virtual whiteboard with a short intro/outro by the professor, and I would have appreciated a bit more production value like in Computer Vision where there is a mix of slides/camera angles/reading to break the monotony a bit.",

You begin with six weeks of fairly interesting lectures + online assignments that aren't too crazy. Then you have three weeks or so to complete the first project. If you had a good grasp on the lecture material it takes maybe 3 to 5 hours to come up with a working solution, though I spent 20+ hours trying and failing at the extra credit portion. Then the class ends with a larger project that definitely requires you to comprehend and do research beyond what was covered in the lectures. You can work alone or in groups up to four. I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it. There was also an extra credit option where you actually build a robot and implement some of the ideas of the course, though unfortunately I did not get time to engage with that aspect of the course. \n\nCompared to other classes this one had a less interaction with staff or other students, perhaps because enrollment is smaller and there were less assignments. The instructors were not particularly active on Piazza. There were three office hours which were constantly rescheduled and even with few Piazza posts there was often slow turnaround for responses. There was a small group of students, though, who were quite active and helpful.",

The professor basically lets the TAs run the class. \n\nAssignments\n\nMost of the assignments in this class are difficult. For instance, I spent over 30 hours on assignment 2. The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks. This class was significantly harder than all of those. I got an A, but it took many hours.",

            "text": "Hmm, interesting course overall - in the end, I got the A I wanted but my brutally honest assessment of myself is that I didn't earn that A. In terms of the R programming side of the course, I use R on a daily basis at work so the assignments were a breeze. The projects were cool and make the student think and formulate informed hypotheses about the data. Based on my own grades, I felt like some parts of the project (the second project in particular) were graded too leniently (i. e., some parts where I felt I put \"adequate\" answers, but nowhere near the best answer or result possible, I still got full marks). \n\nThe final was baffling (in terms of the grade I got on it). My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record. Given that, it remains to be seen how generously this course will be graded in the future.",

            "text": "I was hoping to get a glimpse into modern software architecture and design techniques, but instead, I got UML. In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of \"busy work\" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious. \n\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn't help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn't need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it. \n\nThe lectures weren't particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn't feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed *all* the assignments (only to get the participation points). In the end, it was a very average course for me. Not particularly bad, but not great either.",

Here's the breakdown of assignments:\n\n10 quizzes - these are all easy and straight from the book and some lectures. Mostly quizzing you on definitions and a few characteristics of certain ideas. Very few times will you find a \"gotcha\" type of question here. \n\n4 Projects - Project 1 was a stack overflow exploit in C. I was new to both C and this type of attack so there were some growing pains here (plenty of resources online). Project 2 I had a blast with, we analyzed malware running on VMs. Project 3 was about decrypting keys using Python. This was a lot of fun even though the grading came back less than I expected, probably my favorite project I've done in this program. Project 4 was all about using Javascript to exploit XSS attacks. The gotchas in this project were a bit rough for me but I got graded really well. \n\n2 Exams (not open book/notes) - It seems that most of these questions came from different places from the text and lectures. At times they could seem like really minute details for questions but it is what it is. If I were to have to do this class over I would go through all the lectures and take notes. This would have helped me a lot. Also the proctoring was a hassle for some students (I had no issues). \n\nExtra credit project - this is offered to give you an additional 10 points to your final grade. Unfortunately part of one of the extra credit projects is totally a \"get all the points or none\" kind of or deal. Seems like an odd format for students who need additional help. \n\nOverall you should get a decent-good grade in this course. I enjoyed it and at times wish I could have focused more on certain aspects of InfoSec. A whole course on network security, or malware, or decryption would be a ton of fun! I recommend this course to anyone, just do a better job of taking lecture notes than I did.",

And it shows. At the end of the semester, a student-run survey found that 15 students learned more on their own versus 2 students learned more from instructions. This is a lost of instructional goal. \n\nThe course composes of 2 unrelated parts. The first part has 4 assignments. The second part has 1 open-ended project. You are assumed to know Python, Scikit-Learn, HDFS, HDMR, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark, GraphX, MLlib, Zeppelin. The provided environments are versions of both local and AWS Docker containers, and Vagrant images with CentOS, CoreOS, and Ubuntu. This gives a feeling of a kid playing with various toys and can't decide which one to take home. The issue is worse when you find out that the provided scripts don't even work out of the box! It is a lost of focus. \n\nThe open-ended project suffers from many problems. When the assignments are graded based on accomplishments and correctness, the project is graded like an English literature class. You can earn good chunk of points by making a video capturing your presentation skills, even if your project is a complete failure. Yet you don't earn any more point for taking more innovative or difficult approaches than other students. This is a lost of consistency. \n\nThis course is completely lost in the big world of data science. You'll be wandering aimlessly too if you follow this course. \n\nHaving said that, this course would be an easy A if that was all you'd care about. You just simply have to work really hard on it. It is a \"work hard, not smart\" kind of course that loses my interest quickly. \n\nGood luck!",

Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams.

            "text": "1) This course is extremely difficult on very many levels. Though the course name is SAD (D stands for Design) this is course involved too much Code Development. So unless you are GREAT in Java programming (I mean, you need to be a Guru in Java, being good enough just won't cut it) please do yourself a favor and skip this course. Mind you, they don't teach you Java on this course at all. \n\n2) All projects are cumulative which is not a bad thing but they take their sweet time to grade and return the previous projects, so if you make mistakes in the previous ones you carry them on to your next projects. So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL). And then you get dinged for that (for something you were never taught to begin with!). \n\n5) Absentee professor. Professor doesn't teach this course. He doesn't appear in any of the course videos or lectures and rarely visits Piazza. Office hours are conducted by TAs and sometimes the professor pops in there. In the 8 OMSCS courses I have taken so far, I have never seen this. The Professors always taught their respective classes. \n\n6) Do NOT expect any grade curving. Even if you score 79. 99%, you will get only a \"C\". For some other courses you can easily get a \"B\" or even \"A\" for 79%. \n\n7) As another student pointed out, this course is way out of touch with the real world. I have been a designer/developer for 20+ years now. Never ever worked on any UML translations.",

            "text": "Context: I have no CS degree, but some previous classes with C++. This was my 1st OMSCS course. \n\nWhile it (currently) only counts as an elective, I feel that this course is a great introduction to the program. It is well designed and executed, touching on a variety of very fundamental CS concepts that are relevant to many other courses in the program. The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren't strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A. \n\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst. The grading for this one also struck me as strange. I see the point(s) that the project was trying to convey, but think that it could be accomplished better in a different format.",

There were 8 projects in total. The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor.

In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course's exams. I did not like the fact that the course's exams only focus on arithmetic even though it is at a graduate level.",

However, I have a strong math background, and it helped me a lot. \n\nLectures: There are a lot of lecture videos. Toward the end of the class (hw 7 and 8), some of them are not needed to do the hws. However, I strongly advise against skipping any videos (cause you'll need to go through them for the final). The lectures contain a lot of mathematical proofs and derivations, so it might get a little dry. However, Professor Bobick did an excellent job of explaining them as well as the concepts and intuition behind all the math. \n\nHomework: There are 8 hw sets. HW1 is only 4% because it is easiest. Other hws are 11% each. In my opinion, HW2 and HW7 are the hardest (so get started early on these). In general, the difficulty of the hws is not in the coding, but it is the parameters. Getting the code to pass the autograder is not a difficult task. However, you'll have to pick the right parameters to produce the right images for the report (the reports consist mostly images and sometimes, short discussion, not essays). Optimizing the code was also a problem for me because I had no CS background. Overall, I don't consider the homework super-difficult. \n\nOther comments: Piazza and Slack are valuable resource, so take advantage of them. Most of the time, when I got stuck at something, the answer was in one of the Piazza's posts. Also, do watch the Youtube Office Hour videos. The TA explains how to do the hws very clearly and in detailed in those videos.",

Since this was my first semester, this class has set a high bar for my courses as it was very well organized and lectures were quite clear. \n\nAssignments were very helpful in deeply understanding some of the OS concepts we covered. Two of them were time-consuming, and I learned very quickly that I needed to start early in order to succeed. That said, it really helps to be familiar with C before the class; I think a lot of people will agree that one of the reasons why the first assignment is so tough is that many people are learning C in the process of doing that assignment. \n\nThe exams (midterm and final) are tough and cover a wide range of concepts, some of which can get very dense. So again, it is best to start very early when studying for the tests -- do not cram!\n\nThis class was definitely challenging but certainly worthwhile. Grading was tough but fair, and you are set to succeed if you put in the effort, even if you make mistakes along the way. It was intense at times and sometimes stressful, but so worth it.

Overall, IOS was a great class for learning more about Linux OS internals, developing against a Linux VM, and getting familiar with the whole OMSCS process. I’ve been out of school since 1995, so this was a nice way to ease back into academics. \n\nThe course grade was 25% midterm, 30% final, 40% projects, and 5% Piazza participation. The midterm covers the first 3/8th of the lectures, and the final covers the last 5/8th. Both tests used lots of multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers to be selected. Overall, the tests were tough but fair. I really liked the coding projects (P1, P3, P4), and project 2 was an interesting experiment. Dr. Ada and the TAs were great overall, and the autograders for the coding projects were very good. \n\nOver the 16 weeks of the course I spent the following hours per week: 16, 27, 19, 5, 9, 14, 12, 11, 28, 11, 14, 7, 16, 0, 17, 12. That’s 218 hours, averaging 13. 6 hr/wk. I stayed ahead, read all the referenced papers (14), and did some additional research. The weeks where I put in 27 and 28 hours were when projects 1 and 3 were first assigned. \n\nI’m only taking one OMSCS course at a time due to family and work commitments, and this was a great first course. I got an A without the curve. My only complaint was that we didn’t get grades for projects 3 and 4 until after the final was over. So, for most of the course, you have to guess how you’re doing based on whether your projects passed all the autograder tests. But when you’re only paying $500 for a course, you have to give up something, which in this case was quick grading feedback from TAs who are also GT students.",

The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA's credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date). \n\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final. \n\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts.

He not having a CS background had a tendency to spend to much time explaining fairly simple concepts. This was reflected in the early assignments too. Generally, people are correct that this can be an easy A. However, if you end up with a bad group this class can be extremely time consuming. I ended up spending an enormous amount of extra time coding this as a few team members did very little and one did absolutely nothing until the day it was due. Due to it, our project ended up being way less than it should have been and felt that our TA was pretty nice to us given the circumstances. With that said I put a ton of hours into it and was very frustrated with how it turned out because of this. Still did get an A which makes me feel a bit better about this but in some ways not happy that the guy who did almost nothing probably also got an A. The last four weeks I was putting in 20+ hours a week.",

The instructor, Dave, is really involved and will probably write to much instead of not enough. TL;DR will happen some, you can't help it. There is no real videos as it is all about the conversations hence the didn't read above. Also, I think the Peer Reviews were mostly crap as most didn't really provide any input anyway. I always did but others just did an exercise instead of a way to help others. The project itself was incredibly open ended and the meat of the class. I thought there were alot of useless projects people took on, however, it might have just been hard to come up with ideas. Here is where you can get a lot or a little out of the class. The TAs and Dave are here to help you in this open ended way. The class is an easy A but it is what you make out of it. You can learn a lot or a little but depends on you. Interesting concept for a class (being lecture less) and has merit. Grading of a class like this does require a finesse which I am thinking is a little lacking at moment. Overall, a fantastic class by a fantastic instructor and would recommend. If nothing else to get use to how upper academia is done. My criticism is just to let people know what they are getting. Note, my project was fun to do but it was one I thought about ahead of time noted below as important.",

The class was definitely time consuming but you will be able to get an A or B if you invest sufficient time. Here are some tips:\n- Get a good pencil and practice writing. We had 5 times exams. The exams were to be hand written, scanned and uploaded. There are some suggestions on the slack group. \n- Start working on the problem sets as early as you can. The problem sets were much harder than what showed up on the actual tests. \n- Make sure you are able to solve all the problem sets. Many times, the exam questions tended to be very similar to some of the problem set questions. \n- Don't feel bad if you are not able to solve the pre-requisite questions. I spent a lot of time preparing for the course, but was not able to solve most of the pre-requisite questions. However, I ended up doing quite well in the course. \n- 5 tests actually made it easier as each week, we just had to master 3 different topics. There was no cumulative final. \n- Join the slack group. You don't need to be active, but do keep an eye out on the discussions. You will learn a lot here. \n- Listen to all the office hours (good or bad). \n- There are lot of external resources which are much better than the Udacity videos. Check the slack group for links (e. g. Harry Porter's videos, MIT algo course, Stamford's Roughgarden's etc). You can go through the topics as they come up each week.",

Quite too much sleep-deprived hacking resulted. \n\nOn the other hand, the exams were well written and the practice exams helpful. I thought the video lectures also very well done. I didn't care much for the teaching interactions though, because they were aloof, with all that implies. Fellow students were more helpful (as is often the case).",

This was a concern and a bit of stress toward the end of the semester, but I was a consenting adult/student like everyone else in the class, so I didn't think it was unfair.

Don't think that simply reading the text and watching the lecture will do it for you... treat everything like a project and don't stop until you've mastered everything inside and out. \n\nThe new structure introduced in Fall '16 did help: \n* The professor gave some good and pertinent lectures toward the beginning of the course\n* The professor and TAs offered some helpful office hours to help with understanding the problems (ask ?'s so you don't merely get a regurgitation of the text or the essence of the problem). \n* The professor allowed/encouraged communication with fellow students on the topics (working problem sets was key)\n* Outside resources were allowed for reference and to help build intuition when the lectures & text failed. \n* \"Re-take\" questions were often offered on exams to try to improve on previous scores. \n\nThis is a tough, but rewarding class in that you get to graduate if you are among the hard-working group that get's to pass it.

            "text": "I am a professional software developer who had never taken a course like AI so almost all of the concepts were new. I had never coded in Python before this class that by the first two weeks, you better be ready to learn as you will already be coding and completing and application in that period of time. Aside the challenge, which I knew it would be, the course lectures were incredibly engaging and the assignments were incredibly tough and engaging. You will know in the first two-three weeks whether you will enjoy the challenge or be defeated by it; however, I will say that if you stick the course, it will be very rewarding. \n\nMy lessons learned and advice is to complete the lectures right away to let the concepts sink in and start the assignments early. You will not be able to do the assignment the night before (trust me, I tried and got burned once). Also, give a good amount of attention and time to the midterm and final. I failed to think the midterm would be as long as the assignments as I was wrong. Many of the polls stated people spent well over 20 hours on the midterm. Also, be sure to understand the grading structure as I completely missed the ball on that. For my semester, it was a curve where everyone above the mean got an A and the professor separated the class on two curves for on campus vs online (which was a point of contention for most but was explained with good reason as on campus had additional time & resources and the means were statistically different to show for it. )\n\nBest of luck in the class and hope you stick through the pain and relish in the accomplishment when you are done.",

On top of that I was accused of using pen and paper while taking the exam, and penalized, which I did not, and cant be seen on video either, while people using headphones were let by, quite unfair, never happened before on any tests.

That being said, yeah, preparations make a (huge!) difference. \n\nI am a slow problem solver and it really takes me sometime for some concepts to make sense, so if you are like me, prepare before you actually enroll.

The topics mostly come from papers published 20-30 years ago but are still relevant (some are the foundations) of modern operating systems. \n\nProjects are interesting but require solid foundation in C/C++. You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary. I wish I had more time to spend time reading those papers, as throughout the semester I only managed to read ~30% of them. However if you watch the lectures, you should be able to do ok in exams. \n\nExams are, as others have stated, brutal. The midterm average was 58. The exams require good understanding of the course materials plus *very* good memorisation. Some questions from past exams reappear so don't forget to review them. \n\nThe grade is curved hence the grade will be relative to others'.

I really appreciate his breadth of knowledge and enthusiasm for the material. I was very impressed (and relieved) by the quality of the online delivery system and Piazza classroom forum. \n\nWhat I liked most about CS 6300 is that it differed from your typical boring, textbook heavy software development course that beats SDLC to death. There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts. We learned Git, Android development, MD format, JUnit testing, and so much more! Many of the tools, such as IntelliJ and Android Studio (and even Git), I had never touched before. I learned so many useful tools and concepts that directly applied to my professional work. \n\nAlthough the majority of reviewers rate this course as easy, I caution others not to under-estimate the effort required. I finished with an A but it did require an all-nighter once or twice to meet deadlines and weekly deliverables. Having a programming background definitely helps, especially Java. If you have zero programming background or you're not strong in it then be prepared to suffer a little. The course will not be impossible but I found it challenging enough to meet deliverables because the week seemed to go by so fast between keeping up with lectures, quizzes, and the assignments themselves. I have over 10 years experience developing in C++, C#, Java, VB. NET, SQL, and some HTML and PHP and I felt I was barely prepared. There was still a lot of new learning I had to do and had to do it fast in order to complete assignments on time. I am thankful my group had others with programming experience.

If you don't understand pointers, referencing, dereferencing, data structures, etc you'll be in for a very rough ride. I 'thought' I knew C from my experience with Arudino work, but boy did I really have to play catch-up. Had I not had the Arduino experience before hand, I would likely have dropped. (A lot of people drop in the first two weeks due to poor C skills. Repeat you must already have some C experience !!)\n\nThe lectures are good and Ada know's her shit and does a good job of teaching it. I had almost no knowledge of how operating systems really worked until I took this class and now I have a much, much better understanding. I was taking this class just to fill electives, but it's one of those classes where I was surprised how much I learned (and how much I didn't know). I'm not planning on writing kernel software anytime soon, but the understanding you get from the class definitely helps even if what you mostly do is front or backend web dev stuff. \n\nAs with most other of the challenging course, start the assignments early. The forums move quickly, so if you fall behind your classmates on the programming schedule, your \"I'm just starting part A\" questions will get a lot less attention if everybody else has already moved on to Part C. If you stay up or ahead of the assignments, then the forums will greatly assist you. (My C got a lot better because I was able to stay in the general flow of the class. Had I fallen behind, I don't know that I would have made it. )\n\nSome of the later assignment build off of earlier ones, so design flaws can catch up with you later in the game. You're given very broad scope to design however you like and grading is through an API. I had a design flaw that I didn't understand that bit me on the last assignment in the extra credit sections.

I think this was one of the ONLY group projects I have enjoyed, mostly because everyone knew what they were doing and actually did the work. It was spectacular. Hardest part for me was some of the diagrams you have to build. A few of them didn't really have good samples so I had to do some comparison from the real world examples I could find and hope it correlated back to what was expected in the class. \n\nSoftware Architecture and Design is what I do for a living, so this class was a breeze for the most part. Completely forgot to turn in one of the projects (wrong date on my calendar, lost 15% of my grade right of the bat) and still got an A. Before this class I had a rather strong hatred for Java.

Not exactly sure what happened, because the lecture materials are the exact same and I understand the assignments were almost the exact same. Sounds like assignments not being returned in a timely fashion is a valid concern, but I imagine should be fixed with future iterations of the class. But some of the complaints about the material and the ambiguity of grading seem unwarranted, I don’t necessarily expect a class to have to explicitly lay out grading criteria ahead of time and they weren’t in the Spring and students did not complain.

It is a lot of material and overall it is very interesting. The grading was fair and was based on 3 projects and 2 tests. \n\nThe tests were short, multiple choice and T/F tests. In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns. Since the class grading involved only 5 assignments Piazza was quiet most of the semester. \n\nI would like to see this class improve since the material is current and well-delivered.

There were a dozen TAs, but no grading criteria or rubrics, while all assignments and final exams were essay like reports... This created a total disaster. Maybe because the grading load was too much, TAs did not seem to spend much time on (or even care about) our tens of pages of reports, and the grading was generous but quite random, with no meaningful feedback given. In fall 2016 they put some example assignments on piazza and after the exam, some students voluntarily shared their exams, but similar answers were given very different scores. One of the answers that got full score was almost identical as mine, but mine got 3/11. After I pointed out that my answer was similar to others but got significant lower score, the professor simply said that happens, but since mine was not perfect, the original grading was valid. So in the end I stuck at 79. 7 with a C... \nAdditionally, after the final exam, many students found out that they were not able to see a big chunk of the final exam-a third of the exam didn't show up on proctor track... I still don't know how they dealt with these angry students. \nI filed the grading grievance and started to take the same class again, because I needed it to graduate. As of now, I haven't heard anything from the grievance, and the semester is already ended. \nSpring 2017 is even worse, the instructor disappeared for the most part of the semester, and we only got 20% grading done two weeks before the final.

They did an amazing job. I just really hate theoretical math. Lets be real here, this is a weeder course that is really hard for the sake or being really hard. If you are not good at math theory, you will probably struggle, a lot. Though the homeworks are worth a small portion of the grade (as is the project), I had to spend almost all my free time after work studying and learning concepts just so that I would be semi competent in the tests, and even after all that time, there is a better than not chance that I will be retaking this as I will have gotten a C. \n\nMy biggest recommendations are to look at the material way before hand. At least a few months before, so you get an idea of what you need to learn. Lots of this stuff takes time to understand and you will find that most of the concepts you need to know are things you did years ago in undergrad. Again, unless you are really good with theory, you will probably have to do tons of practice problems to get an idea of what is going on. \n\nNewer students to the program should take this quickly. It was recommended to me (when the older version of this class was out) to just avoid this in general and go Interactive Intelligence, but I did not listen. I severely regret doing so, as I will be forced to take this until I pass.",
